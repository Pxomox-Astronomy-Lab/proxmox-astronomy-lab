# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-16 Application Security & Software Integrity Policy Template**

## **1. Purpose**  

Ensuring **secure software development and deployment** is critical for **maintaining the integrity, security, and reliability of applications**. This policy defines **application security best practices, integrity verification processes, and secure deployment standards** for all internally and publicly released software.  

This document presents a **custom application security and software integrity policy template**, aligning with **CISv8 best practices, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

---

## **2. Scope**  

This policy applies to **all software development, containerized workloads, and infrastructure deployments**, covering:

- **Internally developed applications**
- **Third-party and open-source software integrations**
- **Containerized applications and Kubernetes workloads**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD pipelines**
- **Publicly released code and APIs**

### **Key Objectives**  

This policy enforces **secure software development and deployment** through:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Secure Software Development** | Applications follow secure coding guidelines and compliance frameworks. |
| **Software Inventory Management** | All software components and dependencies tracked for security. |
| **Software Integrity Verification** | Artifacts signed and validated before deployment. |
| **Container Security & Deployment Hardening** | Containers follow CIS benchmarks and security best practices. |
| **Automated Security Scanning** | Code is scanned for vulnerabilities pre- and post-deployment. |
| **Secure CI/CD Pipelines** | All code commits and deployments go through security validation. |

---

## **3. Compliance Mapping**  

This policy aligns with **industry security frameworks** to maintain best practices:  

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 16 â€“ Application Security & Software Integrity |
| **NIST 800-53** | SA-11 â€“ Developer Security Testing & Evaluation |
| **ISO 27001** | A.14 â€“ Secure Development Lifecycle |

---

## **4. Responsibilities**  

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Secure CI/CD pipelines, manage container security, and enforce application security policies. |
| **Developers** | Follow secure coding guidelines, validate dependencies, and conduct security reviews. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Ensure infrastructure security and enforce software integrity policies. |

---

## **5. Policy Implementation**  

### **5.1 Secure Software Development & Release Management**  

All software development follows **secure coding best practices** and must be **reviewed before release**:  

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Secure Coding Guidelines** | Applications adhere to OWASP, NIST, and CIS development best practices. |
| **Version Control & Code Audits** | All application changes tracked via **Git-based repositories**. |
| **Public Code Management** | Any publicly released code follows **established security guidelines**. |

---

### **5.2 Software Integrity & Artifact Verification**  

All software components must be **tracked, verified, and securely deployed**:  

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Artifact Signing** | All software artifacts are digitally signed to ensure authenticity. |
| **Dependency Security** | Only trusted, verified libraries are used (e.g., vetted open-source packages). |
| **Third-Party Software Security** | External software integrations reviewed for security compliance. |

---

### **5.3 Container & Kubernetes Security**  

Applications deployed in containers and Kubernetes must follow **strict security controls**:  

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Container Hardening** | Images must follow **CIS Docker & Kubernetes benchmarks**. |
| **RBAC for Kubernetes** | Enforced to ensure least privilege access. |
| **Namespace Isolation** | Development, testing, and production environments must be separated. |

---

### **5.4 Secure Deployment & Infrastructure Protection**  

Software deployment processes must **follow security best practices**:  

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CI/CD Security** | Pipelines enforce automated security checks before deployment. |
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security** | All Terraform/Ansible-based configurations follow CIS benchmarks. |
| **TLS & Encryption** | All data in transit and at rest is encrypted using strong ciphers. |

---

### **5.5 Continuous Security Monitoring & Code Scanning**  

All software must be **continuously monitored for security risks**:  

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Automated Code Scanning** | Static and dynamic analysis tools (e.g., GitHub Code Scanning, OWASP ZAP) enforce security compliance. |
| **Vulnerability Patching** | Security patches applied within defined remediation windows. |
| **Application Logging & Monitoring** | Logs sent to centralized SIEM for monitoring and anomaly detection. |

---

### **5.6 Secure Authentication & Access Controls**  

All applications must **integrate with centralized authentication platforms**:  

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Centralized Authentication** | Entra ID secures application and infrastructure access. |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Least privilege applied to application accounts and infrastructure. |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | Enforced for administrative access to production workloads. |

---

## **6. Exception Handling**  

Exceptions to this policy must be **requested in writing** and include:  

- **Justification for the request**  
- **Risk assessment of non-compliance**  
- **Proposed alternative mitigations**  
- **Technical challenges preventing compliance**  
- **Planned review date for reevaluation**  

---

## **7. Enforcement & Non-Compliance**  

Failure to comply with this policy may result in:  

- Restricted access to software development environments  
- Escalation to security teams for further investigation  
- Remedial actions required to restore compliance
