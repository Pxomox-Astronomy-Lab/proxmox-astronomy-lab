# **ðŸ›  CISv8 Secure Configuration Management Policy Template**

## **1. Overview**  

### **Why This Policy Matters**  

The **Secure Configuration Management Policy** ensures that **systems, network devices, and applications are hardened against security threats** by removing **default settings, unnecessary services, and insecure configurations**. Inadequate configuration management can lead to **exploitable vulnerabilities, privilege escalation, and unauthorized system access**.

Key aspects of this policy include:  

âœ… **Establishing secure baseline configurations** for all enterprise assets.  
âœ… **Enforcing security hardening through automation and configuration controls**.  
âœ… **Ensuring continuous monitoring and compliance with industry benchmarks**.  
âœ… **Preventing misconfigurations and security drift over time**.  

This document **presents the CISv8 Secure Configuration Management Policy Template** and includes **additional information on how organizations may implement it**, along with a **generalized example of its application in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

## **2. Compliance Mapping**  

| **Framework**      | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **CIS Controls**   | CIS Control 4 â€“ Secure Configuration Management |
| **NIST 800-53**    | CM-6 (Configuration Settings), SI-2 (Flaw Remediation) |
| **ISO 27001**      | A.12.1 (Security Configuration Management), A.14.2 (Secure Development & Configuration) |

## **3. CISv8 Secure Configuration Management Policy Template**  

```markdown
# Secure Configuration Management Policy Template  

## **Purpose**  
Secure configurations are used to **remove default accounts, passwords, unnecessary services, and insecure settings** that may introduce security vulnerabilities. This policy provides **the processes and procedures for identifying, applying, and maintaining secure configurations throughout the lifetime of all assets and services**.

---

## **Responsibility**  
- **IT is responsible** for implementing and maintaining secure configurations.  
- **Users are responsible** for adhering to security policies and not modifying configurations.  
- **System administrators must ensure compliance with hardening guidelines**.  

---

## **Policy**  

### **4.1 Secure Configuration Planning & Selection**  
1. **Configuration guidelines must be based on industry standards** (CIS Benchmarks, DISA STIGs, vendor best practices).  
2. **A set of secure configurations must be selected before deploying**:  
   - **Operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)**.  
   - **Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)**.  
   - **Network appliances (firewalls, routers, switches, etc.)**.  
3. **If no CIS Benchmark exists**, IT must develop a **custom hardening baseline** based on security best practices.  

---

### **4.2 Secure Configuration Implementation**  
1. **All systems must be configured according to approved security baselines** before deployment.  
2. **Default credentials and accounts must be removed or disabled**.  
3. **Automatic session expirations must be enforced**:  
   - **15 minutes max for user workstations and servers**.  
   - **2 minutes max for mobile devices**.  
4. **Host-based firewalls must be enabled** with default-deny inbound rules.  
5. **Applications and operating systems must be configured for automatic updates** unless an approved patching alternative exists.  

---

### **4.3 Secure Configuration Monitoring & Compliance**  
1. **All secure configurations must be continuously monitored for compliance**.  
2. **Unauthorized changes must trigger alerts and be remediated immediately**.  
3. **Security hardening must be reviewed annually** to incorporate new threats and best practices.  

---

### **4.4 Secure Network & Cloud Configuration**  
1. **All cloud resources must have detailed audit logging enabled**.  
2. **Unused ports, services, and protocols must be disabled** on network devices.  
3. **DNS filtering services must be used to block access to known malicious domains**.  
4. **All network appliances must be configured using up-to-date management protocols** (SSH, SNMPv3, etc.).  

---

### **4.5 Configuration Modification & Change Management**  
1. **All changes to system configurations must be reviewed and approved by IT**.  
2. **Significant updates require timely updates to security baselines**.  
3. **Unauthorized configuration changes trigger security alerts**.  

```

---

## **4. Best Practices for Implementing This Policy**  

Organizations implementing **CIS Control 4 â€“ Secure Configuration Management** should consider:  

- **Using automation to enforce security baselines** â€“ **Group Policy (GPO) and Configuration Management tools** can be used to maintain secure configurations.  
- **Ensuring centralized logging for compliance tracking** â€“ **Third-party logging services such as Loggly or self-hosted such as Prometheus** help identify misconfigurations and detect security drift.  
- **Regularly auditing system hardening levels** â€“ Periodic reviews ensure that **all assets remain in compliance** with CIS benchmarks.  Tools such as CIS-Lite/Pro can help here.
- **Disabling insecure protocols and services** â€“ Legacy and unnecessary features **increase the attack surface** and should be removed.  
- **Applying secure settings across cloud and hybrid environments** â€“ Cloud security misconfigurations can be prevented with **Azure Policy, AWS Config, and Kubernetes security controls**.  

These best practices **help organizations align with industry standards and maintain a secure baseline** across their infrastructure.

## **5. Example Implementation in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**  

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, **CIS Control 4** is implemented through the following methods:

### **5.1 Secure Baseline Configuration Enforcement**  

âœ… **Golden Templates (Pre-hardened OS images) are used for all system deployments**.  
âœ… **Ansible automates enforcement of system hardening policies**.  
âœ… **CIS Benchmarks are used for Linux, Windows, and cloud infrastructure**.  

### **5.2 Cloud & Network Hardening**  

âœ… **Network security rules are managed using a on-prem Fortigate firewall**.  
âœ… **Unused services and legacy protocols are disabled across all network devices**.  

### **5.3 Continuous Monitoring & Compliance**  

âœ… **Wazuh and Lynis perform daily compliance scans** to detect misconfigurations.  
âœ… **Unauthorized system changes trigger alerts in the SIEM**.  
âœ… **Audit logs are reviewed to track security drift and potential risks**.  

---

## **6. Summary and Next Steps**  

âœ… **This document presents the official CISv8 Secure Configuration Management Policy Template.**  
âœ… **It includes additional information on possible implementation strategies.**  
âœ… **A high-level example from the Proxmox Astronomy Lab is provided for reference.**  

ðŸ“Œ **Actionable Next Steps:**  

- **Ensure automated configuration management tools enforce secure settings**.  
- **Regularly audit and remediate security misconfigurations**.  
- **Maintain a centralized repository of security baseline templates**.  

ðŸš€ **By following this framework, organizations can improve their security posture and reduce risks associated with misconfigurations.**
