# ‚öôÔ∏è **3. Implementation Procedures**

This section provides comprehensive procedures for GPO naming convention implementation and enterprise Group Policy management framework deployment.

## **3.1 Naming Convention Framework**

### **Core Naming Structure**

The enterprise GPO naming convention follows a systematic template that ensures consistent organization and CIS Controls v8 alignment:

```
Format Template: CIS##-CATEGORY-SCOPE-Description-Target-v#.#

Component Breakdown:
- CIS##-CATEGORY-    : Control bucket prefix (e.g., CIS08-AUDIT-)
- SCOPE              : Configuration scope (COMP/USER/BOTH)
- Description        : Hyphenated policy description (under 20 characters)
- Target             : Organizational scope (AllDomain/Servers/Workstations/DCs)
- v#.#               : Version tracking (semantic versioning)
```

### **Control Bucket Prefix Implementation**

The control bucket prefix system organizes GPOs according to CIS Controls v8 framework categories:

```
Control Mapping Structure:
CIS01-INV-    : Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets
CIS02-SW-     : Inventory and Control of Software Assets
CIS03-DATA-   : Data Protection
