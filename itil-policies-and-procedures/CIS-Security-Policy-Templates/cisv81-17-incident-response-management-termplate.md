# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-17 Incident Response Policy Template**

## **1. Purpose**  

Incident response ensures that **security incidents, unauthorized access, operational failures, and external threats** are handled **efficiently and with minimal disruption**. This policy defines **structured procedures for reporting, managing, and resolving security incidents** within the enterprise.

This document presents a **custom incident response policy template**, aligning with **CISv8 best practices, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

---

## **2. Scope**  

This policy applies to **all IT assets, network infrastructure, cloud services, and third-party service providers**, covering:

- **Internal and public-facing services**
- **Cloud-based environments (Azure, AWS)**
- **Critical infrastructure and research platforms**
- **Endpoints, workstations, and mobile devices**

### **Key Objectives**  

This policy enforces **structured incident response** through:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Incident Management Leadership** | Designated **Incident Manager** coordinates response efforts. |
| **Incident Reporting** | All security events reported via **ticketing system, email, or escalation phone call**. |
| **Incident Categorization** | Security incidents classified by severity and response priority. |
| **Containment & Remediation** | Affected systems quarantined to minimize impact. |
| **Forensic Analysis & Documentation** | Root Cause Analysis (RCA) conducted post-incident. |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Security incidents reviewed periodically to refine processes. |

---

## **3. Compliance Mapping**  

This policy aligns with **industry security frameworks** to maintain best practices:  

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 17 â€“ Incident Response |
| **NIST 800-53** | IR-4 â€“ Incident Handling |
| **ISO 27001** | A.16 â€“ Information Security Incident Management |
