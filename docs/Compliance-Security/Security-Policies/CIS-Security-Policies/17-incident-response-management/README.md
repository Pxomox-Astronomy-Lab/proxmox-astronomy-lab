# üö® **CIS Control 17: Incident Response**

## üîç **1. Introduction**

CIS Control 17 forms a critical component of our security operations strategy, establishing comprehensive procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents. This control ensures that security events are handled promptly and effectively to minimize potential damage.

Incident response ensures that **security incidents, unauthorized access, operational failures, and external threats** are handled **efficiently and with minimal business disruption**. **CIS Control 17** mandates structured procedures for **detecting, reporting, and mitigating incidents** to prevent security breaches and maintain system integrity.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** employs **a structured incident response process** with **real-time monitoring, reporting, containment, and recovery** to ensure compliance with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

The following table outlines our key incident response components and their implementation:

| **Key Incident Response Features** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Incident Management Leadership** | Incidents are managed by the **Lead Engineer** and **Lab Owner**. |
| **Incident Reporting Methods** | Users report incidents via **Zammad Helpdesk, MS Teams, or phone**. |
| **Cloud & Infrastructure Compliance** | Azure & AWS compliance portals provide monitoring & documentation. |
| **Immediate Threat Mitigation** | Entra ID integration for **identity-based response** and credential revocation. |
| **Periodic Incident Review** | Security incidents **reviewed monthly** to improve response processes. |

This integrated approach ensures comprehensive coverage of the incident response lifecycle, from initial detection through resolution and continuous improvement.

## üéØ **2. Scope**

This control applies to all security incidents within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab environment, establishing clear requirements for incident response while acknowledging practical limitations.

The following table outlines the scope boundaries for our incident response program:

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | All IT assets, network infrastructure, and cloud services. |
| **Out-of-Scope** | Non-production environments and temporary research tools. |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 17, NIST 800-53 (IR-4), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.16.1). |

This defined scope ensures that incident response resources are focused on the most critical systems while maintaining compliance with applicable frameworks.

## üîÑ **3. Incident Response Implementation**

### **3.1 Incident Reporting & Detection**

Timely detection and reporting are critical to effective incident response. Our approach provides multiple reporting channels while ensuring appropriate prioritization.

The following table details our incident reporting implementation:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Primary Reporting Method** | **Zammad Helpdesk (helpdesk.beardinthe.cloud)** for incident tracking. |
| **Alternative Reporting** | MS Teams or direct phone call for urgent incidents. |
| **Incident Escalation** | High-severity incidents reported **immediately to the Lead Engineer**. |

These reporting channels ensure that security incidents are promptly identified and tracked throughout the resolution process.

### **3.2 Incident Containment & Mitigation**

Once detected, incidents must be contained to prevent further damage. Our approach provides a structured containment methodology appropriate to the incident severity.

The following table outlines our containment and mitigation implementation:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Containment & Isolation** | Infected systems quarantined as per protocol. |
| **Incident Logging** | Actions recorded in **Zammad ticketing system**. |
| **Immediate Threat Response** | Entra ID used for real-time access revocation. |

These containment measures ensure that security incidents are promptly addressed to minimize potential impact.

### **3.3 Incident Resolution & Recovery**

Following containment, incidents must be fully resolved and affected systems restored to normal operation. Our approach ensures thorough remediation and validation.

The following table outlines our resolution and recovery implementation:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Resolution Plan** | Incident response team coordinates remediation. |
| **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** | Conducted for all high-severity incidents. |
| **System Recovery Validation** | Ensures impacted systems are **fully restored**. |

This structured approach ensures that incidents are completely resolved while identifying and addressing underlying causes.

### **3.4 Incident Review & Continuous Improvement**

Regular review of security incidents enables ongoing improvement of our incident response capabilities. Our approach incorporates lessons learned into process refinements.

The following table outlines our review and improvement implementation:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Monthly Incident Review** | Reports analyzed for trends and response improvements. |
| **Lessons Learned Documentation** | Findings documented for internal training. |
| **Policy Adjustments** | Incident response policies updated based on threat analysis. |

This continuous improvement cycle ensures that our incident response capabilities remain effective against evolving threats.

## üìä **4. Compliance Evidence**

Maintaining evidence of control implementation is essential for demonstrating compliance and ensuring continued effectiveness. Our documentation provides comprehensive coverage of each sub-control's implementation.

The following table maps CIS Control 17 sub-controls to our implementation documentation:

| **Control** | **Implementation Details** | **Reference Document** |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **17.1** | Incident response plan and reporting procedures. | [CISv8 17.1 Implementation](./17.1.md) |
| **17.2** | Incident detection, containment, and remediation. | [CISv8 17.2 Implementation](./17.2.md) |
| **17.3** | Root cause analysis and security incident logging. | [CISv8 17.3 Implementation](./17.3.md) |
| **17.4** | Post-incident review and process improvement. | [CISv8 17.4 Compliance](./17.4.md) |

This structured documentation approach ensures that all aspects of the control are properly addressed and verified through regular assessment.
