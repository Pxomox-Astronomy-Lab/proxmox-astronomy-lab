# üéì **CIS Control 14: Security Awareness Training**

## üîç **1. Introduction**

CIS Control 14 forms a critical component of our human-centered security strategy, establishing comprehensive training programs that transform users from potential vulnerabilities into active security assets. This control ensures that all personnel understand their role in maintaining security and can recognize and respond to threats appropriately.

Security awareness training ensures that **all employees, contractors, and users understand cybersecurity risks and best practices** to protect enterprise assets. **CIS Control 14** mandates structured **training programs, phishing simulations, and continuous updates** to enhance security culture.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** employs a **comprehensive security training strategy** to ensure compliance with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

The following table outlines our key security awareness components and their implementation:

| **Key Security Awareness Features** | **Implementation** |
|------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Onboarding Security Training** | All new users must complete cybersecurity training before gaining system access. |
| **Annual Cybersecurity Training** | Users complete **mandatory annual training** on best security practices. |
| **Phishing Simulations** | Microsoft Defender Security Awareness Training, plus third-party training as needed. |
| **Incident Reporting Training** | Users are trained to recognize and report security threats. |
| **Compliance Tracking & Remediation** | Training completion monitored, additional training assigned if needed. |

This integrated approach ensures that security awareness becomes an integral part of our organizational culture rather than just a compliance exercise.

## üéØ **2. Scope**

This control applies to all personnel with access to lab resources, establishing clear requirements for security training while acknowledging practical limitations in implementation.

The following table outlines the scope boundaries for our security awareness program:

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | All employees, contractors, and users with access to lab resources. |
| **Out-of-Scope** | Guest accounts with no enterprise resource access. |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 14, NIST 800-53 (AT-2), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.7.2). |

This defined scope ensures that training resources are focused on individuals with access to sensitive information or systems, providing appropriate coverage while maintaining efficiency.

## üîÑ **3. Security Awareness Training Implementation**

### **3.1 Security Training Development & Implementation**

A comprehensive security training program forms the foundation of our security awareness strategy. This program addresses both general security principles and threats specific to our environment.

The following table details our training implementation:

| **Training Type** | **Implementation** |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Onboarding Security Training** | Mandatory training before granting system access. |
| **Annual Security Training** | Required yearly training to reinforce cybersecurity principles. |
| **Threat-Based Training Updates** | Training adjusted based on emerging threats and attack trends. |

This structured approach ensures that all personnel receive appropriate training at the right time, with regular reinforcement of key security concepts.

### **3.2 Security Awareness Topics Covered**

Our security awareness training addresses a broad range of topics to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential threats and security best practices.

The following table outlines the key security topics included in our training program:

| **Topic** | **Training Focus** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Phishing & Social Engineering** | How to detect and report phishing attempts. |
| **Authentication Security** | Best practices for passwords, MFA, and secure logins. |
| **Data Protection & Compliance** | Proper handling of sensitive data and enterprise security policies. |
| **Incident Reporting** | Steps to report and respond to security incidents. |
| **Safe Internet & Email Practices** | Recognizing security threats in online communications. |

This comprehensive curriculum ensures that users understand both the technical and behavioral aspects of security.

### **3.3 Phishing Simulations & Attack Testing**

Theoretical knowledge must be reinforced with practical experience to be most effective. Our simulated security exercises provide this hands-on component of security awareness.

The following table outlines our approach to security simulations:

| **Security Measure** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Phishing Simulations** | Conducted via **Microsoft Defender Security Awareness Training**. |
| **Failure Response** | Users failing tests are **automatically enrolled in additional training**. |
| **Training Metrics** | Results tracked to improve awareness and response times. |

These simulations provide measurable data on security awareness while creating opportunities for targeted improvement.

### **3.4 Security Training Compliance & Tracking**

To ensure the effectiveness of our training program, we maintain accurate records of training completion and compliance status.

The following table outlines our approach to compliance tracking:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Training Compliance Tracking** | Managed via enterprise LMS or security platform. |
| **Security Audits** | Annual security awareness compliance review. |
| **Automated Reminders** | Notifications sent for incomplete training. |

This structured tracking approach ensures accountability while providing the data needed to assess training effectiveness.

### **3.5 Continuous Training & Program Updates**

Security threats evolve constantly, and our training program adapts accordingly. Regular updates ensure that our training remains relevant and effective.

The following table outlines our approach to maintaining current training materials:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Annual Content Review** | Training materials reviewed and updated yearly. |
| **Threat Intelligence Integration** | New threats incorporated into training. |
| **User Feedback** | Input collected to enhance training effectiveness. |

This continuous improvement cycle ensures that our training program remains effective against evolving threats.
