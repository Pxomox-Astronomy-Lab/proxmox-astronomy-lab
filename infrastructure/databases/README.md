# üóÑÔ∏è **Database Infrastructure**

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for database infrastructure within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab, including PostgreSQL cluster management, astronomical data optimization, backup procedures, and performance monitoring supporting enterprise DESI DR1 analysis and astronomical computing workloads. Our database infrastructure provides the foundation for scientific data analysis and research productivity.

## **Overview**

The database infrastructure serves as the critical data management layer for our enterprise astronomical computing platform, providing high-performance PostgreSQL clusters optimized for large-scale astronomical datasets and complex analytical queries. Our implementation supports real DESI DR1 analysis with 30GB+ datasets, enabling sophisticated astronomical research including cosmic void galaxy analysis, quasar outflow studies, and anomaly detection workflows.

Our database architecture encompasses production PostgreSQL 16 deployments on dedicated VMs within our hybrid infrastructure, specialized optimization for astronomical workloads and time-series data, comprehensive backup and recovery procedures ensuring data protection, and integrated monitoring providing visibility into database performance and query optimization opportunities. The infrastructure supports both transactional workloads and analytical processing requirements essential for modern astronomical research.
