# **üîê CIS Control 5: Account Management in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**

## **1. Introduction**

Effective **account management** is critical to preventing **unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and credential abuse**. **CIS Control 5** enforces **identity governance, least privilege, and access auditing** to ensure **all accounts are properly managed and secured**.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** enforces structured **identity and access management (IAM) practices** through automation, governance, and security controls.

| **Security Measure** | **Implementation** |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Account Auditing** | Quarterly reviews for all user, service, and system accounts. |
| **Identity Governance** | Entra Access Packages & Reviews manage role-based access. |
| **Authentication Security** | Enforced MFA, risk-based sign-ins, and strong password policies. |
| **Lifecycle Management** | Automated detection and removal of inactive accounts. |
| **Least Privilege Enforcement** | No persistent admin access; Just-In-Time (JIT) privilege elevation. |

## **2. Scope**

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | All **user, system, and service accounts** (AD, Entra, and on-prem, including Azure Arc-managed assets). |
| **Out-of-Scope** | Temporary accounts outside compliance scope. |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 5, NIST 800-53 (AC-2, IA-4), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.9.2.1, A.9.4.2). |

## **3. Sub-Control Implementation**

### **Account Inventory & Lifecycle Management**

All accounts are actively tracked, reviewed, and governed through automated processes.

| **Control** | **Implementation** |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Quarterly Account Audits** | AD and Entra accounts reviewed every 90 days. |
| **Automated Inactive Account Detection** | Ansible OSQuery scans disable inactive accounts. |
| **External Account Access Reviews** | Entra enforces periodic user verification for external users. |
| **Enforced Account Lifecycle Policies** | AD user status syncs with Entra for automated disablement. |

### **Authentication & Access Security**

Strict authentication policies enforce secure access across all user and system accounts.

| **Security Measure** | **Enforcement** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Password Policies** | 30+ character passphrases for service accounts; 16+ character user passwords. |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | Enforced for all users (internal & external). |
| **Risk-Based Sign-In Detection** | Conditional Access enforces risk-based authentication restrictions. |
| **Blocked Legacy Authentication** | CA policies disable legacy authentication protocols. |

### **Privilege Management & Just-In-Time Access**

Role-based access control (RBAC) and Just-In-Time (JIT) access ensure least privilege enforcement.

| **Access Control** | **Implementation** |
|--------------------|------------------|
| **No Persistent Admin Accounts** | Admin access is separate from standard accounts. |
| **Just-In-Time (JIT) Access** | Privileged roles require JIT elevation via Entra. |
| **Access Packages in Entra** | Assigns access based on role and identity verification. |
| **Service Account Privilege Enforcement** | No excessive permissions; automated password rotation. |
