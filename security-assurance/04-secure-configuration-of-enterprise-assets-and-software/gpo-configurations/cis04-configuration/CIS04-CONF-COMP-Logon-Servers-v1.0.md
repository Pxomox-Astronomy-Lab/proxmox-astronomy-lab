# 🔐 **CIS04-CONF-COMP-Logon-Servers-v1.0**

This document provides comprehensive configuration details for the Windows Server Logon security hardening Group Policy Object, implementing CIS Control 4 (Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software) through systematic local user enumeration prevention on Member Servers to maintain enterprise security boundaries and reduce information disclosure on server systems in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab infrastructure.

# 🎯 **1. Introduction**

This section establishes the foundational context for Server Logon security configuration within the enterprise Windows hardening framework.

## **1.1 Purpose**

This subsection explains how the Server Logon GPO contributes to systematic security hardening by preventing local user account enumeration on Member Servers that could enable reconnaissance and credential harvesting attacks.

The Server Logon GPO implements critical security controls by systematically preventing enumeration of local user accounts on domain-joined Member Servers, blocking reconnaissance activities that could reveal local administrator accounts, reducing information disclosure that assists in targeted attacks, and maintaining server security boundaries while supporting legitimate authentication workflows. This configuration ensures that server logon operations maintain enterprise security boundaries while preserving administrative functionality essential for server management and legitimate system administration.

## **1.2 Scope**

This subsection defines the boundaries of Server Logon security configuration within the Windows Server 2025 security baseline implementation.

The GPO applies server-specific logon security controls to domain-joined Member Servers across the infrastructure, targeting Windows Server logon functionality through registry policy enforcement. The configuration scope encompasses local user enumeration prevention, server information protection, and administrative reconnaissance reduction, providing systematic protection against information disclosure while maintaining operational functionality for approved server management and legitimate administrative access.

# 🔗 **2. Dependencies & Relationships**

This section maps how the Server Logon GPO integrates with other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security components, establishing both upstream and downstream dependencies.

## **2.1 Related Services**

This subsection identifies other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security services that interact with Server Logon security configuration management.

The Server Logon GPO operates within the comprehensive server security framework, coordinating with server management systems, administrative access controls, and domain authentication to ensure consistent server logon security across the infrastructure while maintaining approved administrative functionality.

## **3.2 Configuration Specifications**

This subsection provides detailed registry settings, values, and technical implementation parameters for the Server Logon security configuration based on actual deployment evidence.

The GPO implements critical server security control through precise registry configuration, ensuring comprehensive protection against local user enumeration while maintaining operational compatibility.

### **Registry Configuration Details**

**Implementation Evidence from Deployment Log (2025-07-27 17:47:43)**:

| **CIS Reference** | **Setting Description** | **Registry Implementation** | **Deployed Value** |
|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **18.9.28.4** | **Enumerate Local Users on Member Servers** | `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System\EnumerateLocalUsers` | `0` (Disabled) |

### **Detailed Policy Configuration**

**GPO Details from Implementation Log**:

- **GPO ID**: `bffdc2dd-15ce-4041-99d7-51d56fdc05a4`
- **Domain**: `radioastronomy.io`
- **Creation Time**: `7/27/2025 5:47:43 PM`
- **Status**: `AllSettingsEnabled`
- **Description**: `CIS 18.9.28.4: Prevents the enumeration of local users on domain-joined Member Servers.`

### **Security Control Explanation**

The Server Logon security setting provides targeted protection:

- **Local User Enumeration Prevention**: Blocks enumeration of local user accounts on Member Servers
- **Information Disclosure Reduction**: Prevents revelation of local administrator and service accounts
- **Reconnaissance Attack Mitigation**: Reduces information available for targeted attacks against servers
- **Administrative Account Protection**: Helps protect local administrator accounts from discovery

### **Server-Specific Application**

This GPO specifically targets Member Servers because:

- **Higher Risk Profile**: Servers typically have more privileged local accounts
- **Administrative Target**: Servers are common targets for privilege escalation attacks
- **Service Account Protection**: Servers often run services with local accounts
- **Infrastructure Security**: Server compromise can impact entire infrastructure
