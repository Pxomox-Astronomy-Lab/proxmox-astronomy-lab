# **ðŸ“œ CISv8 Software Asset Management Policy Template**

## **1. Overview**  

### **Why This Policy Matters**  

Effective **software asset management** ensures that an organization **tracks, monitors, and enforces compliance for installed software across enterprise devices**. Poor software asset control **increases risk exposure**, including **unauthorized software installations, unpatched vulnerabilities, and software licensing non-compliance**.

Key aspects of this policy include:  

âœ… **Maintaining an up-to-date inventory of all installed software.**  
âœ… **Ensuring that only approved and authorized software is installed.**  
âœ… **Automating software updates and vulnerability patching.**  
âœ… **Removing unauthorized or end-of-life (EOL) software.**  

This document **presents the CISv8 Software Asset Management Policy Template** and includes **additional information on how organizations may implement it**, along with a **generalized example of its application in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

# Software Asset Management Policy Template  

## **Purpose**  
Software asset management is the process of procuring, identifying, tracking, maintaining, and removing software on enterprise assets. This Software Asset Management Policy provides the policies for governing the software asset lifecycle while an enterprise is using a software asset. A software inventory must be created and maintained to support the enterpriseâ€™s mission and to help ensure only authorized software is installed and used. This software inventory must be up-to-date and reflect the current state of software across the enterprise.  

---

## **Responsibility**  
The IT business unit is responsible for all software asset management functions. This information is relayed to other business units within the enterprise such as finance, accounting, and cybersecurity as needed. IT is responsible for informing all users of their responsibilities in the use of any assets assigned to them.

## **Policy**  

### **4.1 Software Procurement & Inventory Management**  
1. **Only IT personnel are authorized to procure software.**  
2. **Software must be purchased only from approved vendors** maintained in the IT procurement list.  
3. **IT must maintain an inventory of all software**, including:  
   - Software title & publisher  
   - Date of acquisition & installation  
   - Business purpose & deployment mechanism  
   - App store(s) or source  
   - Software version & update status  
   - End-of-support (EoS) & end-of-life (EoL) dates  
   - Any licensing information  

---

### **4.2 Software Installation & Usage Compliance**  
1. **Only IT-approved software may be installed on enterprise assets.**  
2. **Cloud services used in the enterprise must be pre-approved.**  
3. **Software installed on mobile devices must originate from trusted sources.**  
4. **IT configures automatic updates** where feasible to ensure compliance.  

---

### **4.3 Unauthorized Software Discovery & Response**  
1. **IT must review all installed software monthly for compliance.**  
   - Any newly detected software is checked against the approved software list.  
2. **Unauthorized software must be removed unless an exception is granted.**  
3. **Non-compliant assets are quarantined until software is removed or approved.**  
4. **All unauthorized software cases must be documented and reviewed.**  

---

### **4.4 Software Updates & Patching**  
1. **All software updates must be pre-approved by IT.**  
2. **Enterprise assets must be configured for automatic updates,** where feasible.  
3. **Any system running outdated or unsupported software must be documented.**  
4. **All high-severity vulnerabilities (CVE scores â‰¥ 7) must be patched within 5 days.**  

---

### **4.5 Software Decommissioning & Removal**  
1. **Retired software must be removed from all enterprise assets.**  
2. **Systems running EOL software must be isolated until mitigated.**  
3. **IT must verify that retired software does not store data in unauthorized locations.**  
4. **All software removals must be logged and documented.**  
```

## **4. Best Practices for Implementing This Policy**  

Organizations implementing **CIS Control 2 â€“ Software Asset Management** may consider the following best practices:  

- **Automated Software Inventory Management** â€“ Use **automated tools like endpoint detection and response (EDR), SIEM integrations, or system management tools** to track software installations.  
- **Strict Access Control for Software Installations** â€“ **Restrict software installation privileges** to only **authorized users** using **Group Policy, AppArmor, or Linux package managers**.  
- **Automate Software Patching & Updates** â€“ Configure **centralized software update policies** for **Windows (WSUS), Linux (APT/YUM), and cloud environments**.  
- **Regular Compliance Audits** â€“ Conduct **quarterly software audits** to ensure **only authorized and up-to-date software is installed**.  

These strategies can help **align an organizationâ€™s software asset management with CIS recommendations** while **enhancing security against unauthorized applications**.

## **5. Example Implementation in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**  

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, **CIS Control 2** is implemented through the following methods:

### **5.1 Software Inventory & Compliance Tracking**  

âœ… **Snipe-IT and Osquery are used for software inventory tracking.**  
âœ… **All software installations must be pre-approved and logged in Snipe-IT.**  
âœ… **Monthly compliance audits ensure only authorized software is installed.**  

### **5.2 Unauthorized Software Detection & Removal**  

âœ… **Osquery scans detect unauthorized software and generate compliance reports.**  
âœ… **Non-compliant assets are flagged for review and quarantined if necessary.**  
âœ… **Unauthorized software installation attempts are logged and investigated.**  

### **5.3 Automated Patching & Updates**  

âœ… **Windows updates are managed through WSUS and enforced via Group Policy.**  
âœ… **Linux updates are automated using Ansible and package managers (APT/YUM).**  
âœ… **All critical vulnerabilities (CVE â‰¥ 7) must be patched within 5 days.**

## **6. Summary and Next Steps**  

âœ… **This document presents the official CISv8 Software Asset Management Policy Template.**  
âœ… **It includes additional information on possible implementation strategies.**  
âœ… **A high-level example from the Proxmox Astronomy Lab is provided for reference.**  

ðŸ“Œ **Actionable Next Steps:**  

- **Regularly audit and update software inventories** to reflect changes in infrastructure.  
- **Implement automation to track installed software and detect unauthorized applications.**  
- **Strengthen enforcement of software compliance policies using group policies and access controls.**  

ðŸš€ **By following this framework, organizations can improve their software asset management and maintain compliance with security best practices.**
