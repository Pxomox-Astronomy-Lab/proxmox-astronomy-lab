# üê≥ **Containerized Services**

# üîç **1. Overview**

This section documents the containerization platforms that form the foundation for application deployment in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. Our container strategy combines Docker-based deployments via Portainer for simpler workloads with a full Kubernetes cluster for scalable, resilient research applications.

Containerization provides consistent deployment, isolation, and resource management across our diverse application portfolio, supporting both operational infrastructure and scientific research workloads.
