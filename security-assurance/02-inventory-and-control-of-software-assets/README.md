# 📦 **CIS Control 2: Inventory and Control of Software Assets**

This directory contains the implementation of CIS Control 2: Inventory and Control of Software Assets for the Proxmox Astronomy Lab, focusing on actively managing (inventory, track, and correct) all software on the network so that only authorized software is installed and can execute, and unauthorized and unmanaged software is found and prevented from installation or execution. This control builds upon CIS Control 1 to establish comprehensive software asset management across our astronomical computing platform.

## **Overview**

CIS Control 2 addresses the critical need for software asset visibility and control, recognizing that malicious attackers continuously scan enterprises for software versions with known vulnerabilities. Our implementation provides systematic software inventory management, unauthorized software detection, and application allowlisting appropriate for our research computing environment while supporting astronomical analysis applications and specialized research software.

The control implementation addresses the unique requirements of astronomical research computing including diverse scientific software packages, specialized analysis tools, containerized applications, and AI/ML frameworks while maintaining security controls appropriate for our hybrid infrastructure combining physical nodes, virtual machines, and Kubernetes orchestration.
