# üîÑ **CISv8-11 Data Recovery Policy**

## üîç **1. Overview**

This policy establishes the framework for ensuring business continuity through comprehensive data protection mechanisms. By implementing structured backup, storage, and recovery procedures, we maintain the integrity and availability of critical information assets.

### **1.1 Why This Policy Matters**

Data recovery ensures that enterprise-critical information remains **protected, available, and recoverable** in the event of **cybersecurity incidents, hardware failures, or natural disasters**. This policy defines the **backup, encryption, retention, and recovery processes** for the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

### **1.2 Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **data recovery and protection** through multiple complementary mechanisms that work together to ensure data resilience:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Daily Backups** | All lab data is backed up daily with a 14-day retention period. |
| **Offsite Storage for Redundancy** | 4 weekly and 1 monthly backup are stored offsite in Wasabi. |
| **Encryption of Backup Data** | All backups are encrypted using enterprise keys. |
| **Quarterly Recovery Testing** | A Windows and Linux VM are restored quarterly to validate recoverability. |
| **Access Controls for Backup Data** | Backup files are protected against unauthorized access or modification. |

This integrated approach ensures both the security and availability of backup data throughout its lifecycle, providing a reliable foundation for business continuity.

---

## üìä **2. Compliance Mapping**

Our data recovery strategy aligns with multiple industry frameworks to ensure comprehensive coverage and best practices implementation. These mappings help demonstrate our security posture to stakeholders and ensure regulatory compliance.

The following table shows how this policy maps to established security frameworks:

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 11 ‚Äì Data Recovery |
| **NIST 800-53** | CP-9 ‚Äì Information System Backup |
| **ISO 27001** | A.12.3 ‚Äì Backup & Recovery Management |

By aligning with these frameworks, we ensure our data recovery strategy meets industry standards while providing protection appropriate to our environment.

## üë• **3. Responsibilities**

Effective data recovery requires clear role definition and accountability across the organization. Each role has specific responsibilities that contribute to our overall business continuity posture.

The following table outlines the primary responsibilities for implementing and maintaining our data recovery controls:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Implement and manage backup solutions, ensure encryption, and conduct recovery tests. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Verify successful backup completion, enforce retention policies, and assist in recovery efforts. |
| **Users** | Store enterprise data in approved locations to ensure backup coverage. |

This clear delineation of responsibilities ensures that data recovery remains a priority at all levels of the organization with appropriate oversight and execution.

## üíæ **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Backup Planning & Execution**

A well-designed backup strategy is the foundation of effective data recovery. Our approach ensures comprehensive data protection through structured processes and automation.

The following table outlines our backup planning and execution requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Backup Scope** | All critical lab data is included in daily backups. |
| **Backup Automation** | Backups are automated via enterprise backup software. |
| **Retention Policy** | Data is retained for **14 days**, with **weekly and monthly backups offsite**. |
| **Encryption & Security** | All backups are encrypted with enterprise keys. |

This structured approach ensures consistent protection of critical data while maintaining operational efficiency through automation.

---

### **4.2 Secure Backup Storage**

Proper storage of backup data is essential for both security and availability. Our approach implements multiple safeguards to protect backup integrity.

The following table outlines our backup storage security requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Onsite Backup Storage** | Stored in secure, access-controlled environments. |
| **Offsite Backup Storage** | Backups stored in **Wasabi cloud storage** with **restricted access**. |
| **Backup Isolation** | Offsite backups **are not directly accessible from the network**. |
| **Data Integrity Verification** | Regular integrity checks on stored backups. |

These measures ensure that backup data remains protected from both physical and logical threats while remaining accessible for legitimate recovery operations.

---

### **4.3 Data Encryption & Security**

Encryption is a critical component of backup security, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access throughout its lifecycle.

The following table outlines our backup encryption requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Encryption Algorithm** | AES-256 encryption applied to all backup data. |
| **Key Management** | Encryption keys managed through enterprise key infrastructure. |
| **Access Restrictions** | Only authorized personnel can decrypt backup data. |

This comprehensive encryption approach ensures that backup data remains protected even if physical security measures are compromised.

---

### **4.4 Data Recovery Testing**

Regular testing is essential to validate the effectiveness of our backup strategy and ensure readiness for actual recovery scenarios.

The following table outlines our recovery testing requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Quarterly Recovery Testing** | A Windows and Linux VM are restored every 3 months. |
| **Disaster Recovery Simulation** | IT performs simulated recoveries as part of annual audits. |
| **Recovery Documentation** | Test results and recovery times are logged for review. |

These testing activities provide confidence in our recovery capabilities while identifying potential issues before they impact actual recovery operations.

---

### **4.5 Incident Response & Data Restoration**

When recovery is necessary, a structured approach ensures efficient and complete restoration while maintaining security throughout the process.

The following table outlines our incident response and restoration requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Incident Response Activation** | IT follows the **Data Recovery Plan** in coordination with security teams. |
| **Prioritization of Recovery** | Critical systems restored first based on impact analysis. |
| **Monitoring During Recovery** | System performance and integrity checked post-recovery. |
| **User Notification** | Relevant stakeholders informed of recovery progress and completion. |

This structured approach ensures that recovery operations are performed efficiently while maintaining appropriate communication with affected users.
