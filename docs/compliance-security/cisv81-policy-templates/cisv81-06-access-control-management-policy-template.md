# **ðŸ” CISv8 Access Control Management Policy Template**

## **1. Overview**  

### **Why This Policy Matters**  

The **Access Control Management Policy** ensures that **only authorized users, devices, and services** can access enterprise resources, reducing risks related to **unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and account compromise**. Access control is a **fundamental component of Zero Trust security models**.

Key aspects of this policy include:  

âœ… **Enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**.  
âœ… **Requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for external, remote, and privileged access**.  
âœ… **Implementing strong access governance via automated account provisioning and deprovisioning**.  
âœ… **Centralizing authentication and enforcing secure access across hybrid environments**.  

This document **presents the CISv8 Access Control Management Policy Template** and includes **additional information on how organizations may implement it**, along with a **generalized example of its application in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

| **Framework**      | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **CIS Controls**   | CIS Control 6 â€“ Access Control Management |
| **NIST 800-53**    | AC-3 (Access Enforcement), AC-6 (Least Privilege), IA-5 (Authenticator Management) |
| **ISO 27001**      | A.9.1 (Access Control), A.9.2 (User Access Management), A.9.4 (System Access Control) |

## **3. CISv8 Access Control Management Policy Template**  

```markdown
# Access Control Management Policy Template  

## **Purpose**  
Access control management is the process of **granting, managing, and revoking access** to enterprise assets in a controlled and auditable manner. This policy ensures that:  
- **Users access only the resources necessary for their role (Least Privilege Enforcement).**  
- **All administrative and remote access requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).**  
- **Unauthorized access attempts are logged, monitored, and investigated.**  

---

## **Responsibility**  
- **IT is responsible** for implementing and enforcing access control policies.  
- **Users must follow security best practices and report any unauthorized access.**  
- **System administrators must maintain an access review process and ensure compliance.**  

---

## **Policy**  

### **6.1 Access Granting & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
1. **Access must be granted through structured, reviewable processes.**  
   - **Permissions must align with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies.**  
   - **Access Packages define structured access for user roles.**  
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enabled for all privileged and remote accounts.**  
3. **Privileged accounts must use Just-In-Time (JIT) elevation rather than persistent admin access.**  

---

### **6.2 Access Revocation & Offboarding**  
1. **Accounts must be disabled immediately upon termination or extended leave.**  
2. **Inactive accounts must be reviewed quarterly and disabled if not in use.**  
3. **Entra Identity Governance - Access Reviews enforce periodic revalidation of permissions.**  
4. **Guest and third-party accounts must be reviewed every 90 days.**  

---

### **6.3 Authentication & Credential Security**  
1. **All accounts must follow strong authentication security policies:**  
   - **MFA is required for all externally accessible applications.**  
   - **Privileged access must use FIDO keys or phishing-resistant MFA.**  
   - **Legacy authentication methods (e.g., NTLM, basic authentication) must be disabled.**  

---

### **6.4 Remote Access Security**  
1. **All remote users must authenticate using Entra Private Access (EPA) with MFA.**  
2. **Direct VPN access is not permitted for externally managed identities.**  
3. **Privileged remote access requires JIT elevation and additional approval.**  

---

### **6.5 Continuous Monitoring & Auditing**  
1. **All authentication and access attempts must be logged and monitored.**  
2. **Entra Identity Protection detects and mitigates risky sign-ins.**  
3. **Azure Sentinel correlates access logs to detect anomalies.**  
4. **Access reviews must be conducted quarterly to ensure least privilege adherence.**  

```

## **4. Best Practices for Implementing This Policy**  

Organizations implementing **CIS Control 6 â€“ Access Control Management** should consider:  

- **Centralizing identity management using Entra ID or Active Directory** â€“ Ensuring consistent enforcement of **RBAC and conditional access policies**.  
- **Applying Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)** â€“ Restricting access based on identity, device compliance, and risk signals.  
- **Enforcing Just-In-Time (JIT) Privileged Access Management (PAM)** â€“ Granting admin access only when required.  
- **Logging and monitoring all authentication attempts** â€“ SIEM solutions detect **anomalies in login patterns and privilege escalation attempts**.  

These best practices help organizations **align with industry standards** while reducing **unauthorized access risks**.

## **5. Example Implementation in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**  

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, **CIS Control 6** is implemented through the following methods:

### **5.1 Identity & Access Management (IAM)**  

âœ… **User accounts are managed using Entra ID and Active Directory.**  
âœ… **Privileged accounts require JIT elevation and use FIDO2 security keys.**  
âœ… **Conditional Access blocks risky sign-ins and enforces strong authentication.**  

### **5.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation**  

âœ… **Entra Identity Governance defines external user role-based permissions via Access Packages.**  
âœ… **Entra Access Reviews are conducted every 90 days to ensure least privilege adherence.**  
âœ… **Kubernetes namespaces enforce granular RBAC policies for containerized workloads.**  

### **5.3 Logging & Compliance Monitoring**  

âœ… **Logging tools such as Loki monitor account activity and detect anomalies.**  
âœ… **Failed login attempts, account lockouts, and privilege escalations generate security alerts.**  
âœ… **Audit logs are retained and reviewed quarterly to ensure compliance.**

## **6. Summary and Next Steps**  

âœ… **This document presents the official CISv8 Access Control Management Policy Template.**  
âœ… **It includes additional information on possible implementation strategies.**  
âœ… **A high-level example from the Proxmox Astronomy Lab is provided for reference.**  

ðŸ“Œ **Actionable Next Steps:**  

- **Ensure all privileged accounts require JIT access and MFA enforcement.**  
- **Conduct regular access reviews to remove unnecessary permissions.**  
- **Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) access control for privileged accounts.**  

ðŸš€ **By following this framework, organizations can enforce strong access control, mitigate identity-related threats, and improve security posture.**
