# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-08 Audit Log Management Policy Template**

## **1. Overview**  

### **Why This Policy Matters**  

Audit log management ensures **visibility into security-relevant events**, enabling organizations to **detect, investigate, and respond to threats** effectively. Without **structured log management**, organizations risk **undetected breaches, compliance violations, and data integrity issues**.

### **Key Aspects of This Policy:**  

âœ… **Ensures comprehensive log collection across critical enterprise assets.**  
âœ… **Defines retention, transmission, and analysis requirements for security logs.**  
âœ… **Supports forensic investigations and compliance monitoring.**  
âœ… **Improves detection and response to security anomalies.**  

This document **presents the CISv8 Audit Log Management Policy Template** and includes **additional information on how organizations may implement it**, along with a **generalized example of its application in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

| **Framework**      | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **CIS Controls**   | CIS Control 8 â€“ Audit Log Management |
| **NIST 800-53**    | AU-2 (Event Logging), AU-6 (Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting) |
| **ISO 27001**      | A.12.4 (Logging and Monitoring) |

```markdown
# Audit Log Management Policy Template  

## **Purpose**  
Audit log management includes generating, storing, and analyzing log files to identify and respond to suspicious or anomalous events occurring within the enterprise. The Audit Log Management Policy provides the processes and procedures for ensuring logs are created, stored securely, and properly analyzed. This policy applies to all departments and all assets connected to the enterprise network.

---

## **Responsibility**  
The Information Technology (IT) business unit is responsible for all log management functions. Specifically, administrators are responsible for configuring the correct devices to generate, store, and transmit logs. IT is responsible for informing all users of their responsibilities in the use of any assets assigned to them. All enterprise assets are required to comply with the enterprise audit logging procedures.

---

## **Exceptions**  
Exceptions to this policy may be requested in writing and must include:  
- The reason for the request,  
- Risk to the enterprise of not following the written policy,  
- Specific mitigations that will not be implemented,  
- Technical and other difficulties, and  
- Date of review.

---

## **Policy**  

### **4.1 Generation**  
1. An enterprise-wide strategy must be developed to establish and maintain an audit log process.  
   - This strategy must be documented.  
   - Documentation must be updated annually, or when significant changes occur.  
   - The contents of logs must be specified within the Secure Configuration Policy.  
2. Audit logging must be enabled on all enterprise assets, where practical.  
3. Audit logs must not be disabled on enterprise assets.  

---

### **4.2 Transmission**  
1. Procedures must be developed to move logs from enterprise assets to an audit log datastore.  
   - This may be done manually or via electronic means.  
2. Access controls must be used to prevent unauthorized modification of audit logs.  

---

### **4.3 Storage**  
1. Procedures must be developed to collect audit logs from enterprise assets.  
2. Sufficient storage space must be allocated for audit logs for the period of time required for analysis and retention.  
   - Sufficient space must be allocated to store audit logs on all enterprise assets.  
   - Sufficient space must be allocated to store audit logs on any centralized audit log datastore.  
3. Retention timeframes for audit logs should align with the enterprise data management process.  

---

### **4.4 Review and Analysis**  
1. All high-severity events must be acted upon in accordance with the audit log management process.  

---

### **4.5 Disposal**  
1. All audit logs must be stored for a period specified by the audit log management process.  
2. Archived logs must be available for analysis.  
3. Disposal of audit logs should align with the enterprise data management process.  
```

## **4. Best Practices for Implementing This Policy**  

Organizations implementing **CIS Control 8 â€“ Audit Log Management** may consider the following best practices:  

- **Centralized Log Collection** â€“ Use **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions** to collect, store, and analyze logs.  
- **Time Synchronization** â€“ Ensure **all systems use synchronized time sources (e.g., NTP servers)** to maintain consistency across logs.  
- **Access Control & Integrity Protection** â€“ Logs must be **protected from tampering and unauthorized access** using **role-based permissions** and encryption.  
- **Log Retention & Archiving** â€“ Retain logs **for at least 90 days** for active analysis and **archive for up to one year** for forensic investigations.  
- **Automated Anomaly Detection** â€“ Use **machine learning-driven SIEM or anomaly detection tools** to flag suspicious log entries.  

These strategies help **align an organizationâ€™s security program with CIS recommendations** while **enhancing resilience against evolving threats**.

## **5. Example Implementation in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**  

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, CIS Control 8 is implemented with the following measures:  

## **5.1 Audit Log Collection & Retention**  

âœ… **Prometheus, Loki, Alert Manager, and Grafana stack used for centralized logging.**  
âœ… **90-day retention period for all logs, with forensic archives stored securely.**  
âœ… **Windows DCs and Technitium DNS servers send logs to a central logging system.**  

## **5.2 Secure Log Storage & Access Control**  

âœ… **Logs stored on separate partitions to prevent corruption from system failures.**  
âœ… **Strict ACLs ensure only security administrators can access log files.**  
âœ… **All logs are signed and hashed to prevent tampering.**  

## **5.3 Automated Monitoring & Alerting**  

âœ… **Wazuh SIEM and Prometheus Alert Manager actively monitor logs for anomalies.**  
âœ… **Security teams receive alerts for high-severity log events.**  
âœ… **Daily log analysis reports generated to review authentication failures, unauthorized access attempts, and system errors.**

## **6. Summary and Next Steps**  

âœ… **This document presents the official CISv8 Audit Log Management Policy Template.**  
âœ… **It includes additional information on possible solutions for implementation.**  
âœ… **A high-level example from the Proxmox Astronomy Lab is provided for reference.**  

ðŸ“Œ **Actionable Next Steps:**  

- **Review existing log management strategies and align them with CISv8 recommendations.**  
- **Implement centralized logging with access controls and anomaly detection.**  
- **Define clear log retention policies to balance compliance and storage costs.**  
- **Continuously monitor log integrity and adjust policies as threats evolve.**  

ðŸš€ **By following this framework, organizations can ensure structured, secure, and effective audit log management.**
