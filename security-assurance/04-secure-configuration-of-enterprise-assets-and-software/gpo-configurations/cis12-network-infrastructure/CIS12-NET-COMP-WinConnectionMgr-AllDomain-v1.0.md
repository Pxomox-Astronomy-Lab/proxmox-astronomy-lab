# üîí **CIS12-NET-COMP-WinConnectionMgr-AllDomain-v1.0**

## **Windows Connection Manager Security Configuration**

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** July 28, 2025  
**GPO Type:** Computer Configuration  
**Target Systems:** All Domain-Joined Computers  
**CIS Control Alignment:** CIS v8 Control 12 (Network Infrastructure Management)

# üìã **1. Implementation Overview**

This Group Policy Object implements Windows Connection Manager security configuration for all domain-joined computers within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab enterprise environment. The GPO minimizes simultaneous network connections by preventing Wi-Fi connectivity when Ethernet is available, reducing attack surface, eliminating dual-homed security risks, and maintaining consistent network security policy enforcement through controlled connection prioritization.

The configuration addresses critical network security requirements by preventing users from establishing multiple concurrent network connections that could bypass security controls, create routing vulnerabilities, or enable unauthorized network bridging essential for maintaining network security boundaries and connection integrity across the domain infrastructure.

## **3.2 Structure and Organization**

The Windows Connection Manager GPO implements one critical network security control through registry modification targeting Windows Connection Manager service configuration:

### **Connection Manager Security Control**

| **Security Control** | **Registry Path** | **Value Name** | **Configuration** | **Security Impact** |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Connection Minimization** | `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WcmSvc\GroupPolicy` | `fMinimizeConnections` | `3` (DWord) | Minimizes simultaneous connections by preventing Wi-Fi when Ethernet is available, reducing dual-homing security risks |

### **Connection Minimization Levels**

| **Level** | **Value** | **Behavior** | **Security Posture** |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Disabled** | `0` | Allow all simultaneous connections | **Insecure** - Dual-homing vulnerabilities |
| **Minimize to single** | `1` | Allow only one connection type | **Moderate** - Basic connection control |
| **Minimize with preference** | `2` | Prefer wired over wireless | **Good** - Connection prioritization |
| **Minimize connections** | `3` | Prevent Wi-Fi when Ethernet available | **Secure** - Comprehensive dual-homing prevention |

### **Implementation Verification**

| **Verification Method** | **Expected Result** | **Validation Command** |
|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Registry Validation** | `fMinimizeConnections = 3` | `Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WcmSvc\GroupPolicy" -Name "fMinimizeConnections"` |
| **Connection Behavior Test** | Wi-Fi disabled when Ethernet connected | Test network adapter behavior with both connection types available |
| **Network Adapter Status** | Only one active connection at a time | `Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Up"}` |

## **3.3 Integration and Procedures**

Windows Connection Manager security implementation follows systematic deployment through Group Policy targeting all domain-joined computers with comprehensive connection control validation.

### **Deployment Procedure**

1. **Pre-Deployment Assessment**
   - Verify domain infrastructure readiness and network connection dependencies
   - Confirm Ethernet infrastructure availability and wireless network requirements
   - Validate user connectivity patterns and mobile device usage scenarios

2. **GPO Implementation**
   - Deploy GPO targeting All Domain Computers through Group Policy Management Console
   - Configure universal application across all domain-joined systems
   - Validate policy precedence and Connection Manager configuration inheritance

3. **Post-Deployment Validation**
   - Force policy update on all domain systems
   - Verify registry modification through administrative validation
   - Test connection behavior with both Ethernet and Wi-Fi available

# üõ†Ô∏è **4. Management & Operations**

## **4.1 Lifecycle Management**

Windows Connection Manager security lifecycle management encompasses connection assessment, systematic deployment, operational monitoring, and continuous security validation based on network connection threat landscape evolution.

## **4.2 Monitoring & Quality Assurance**

**Monitoring Infrastructure:** All monitoring is handled by proj-mon01, the centralized monitoring stack consisting of Prometheus (metrics), Loki (logs), Grafana (visualization), AlertManager (alerting), and Grafana Alloy (metrics/logging agent). Monitoring philosophy follows "if it can be collected, we do" approach with comprehensive network connection monitoring and dual-homing detection.

## **4.3 Maintenance and Optimization**

Windows Connection Manager security maintenance encompasses regular connection configuration validation, dual-homing assessment, network connectivity monitoring, and systematic security control verification for sustained connection security protection.

# üîí **5. Security & Compliance**

## **5.1 Security Framework Alignment**

**Security Disclaimer**: The Windows Connection Manager security configuration documented in this GPO represents a network connection security baseline for Windows domain-joined systems. These configurations should be thoroughly tested in non-production environments before deployment. While these templates follow CIS Controls v8 network infrastructure management framework guidelines, organizations should validate Connection Manager security compatibility with their specific mobile device requirements and wireless connectivity needs. The security research computing team maintains these configurations as implementation guidance rather than production security recommendations, and encourages consultation with dedicated security professionals for enterprise deployment validation.
