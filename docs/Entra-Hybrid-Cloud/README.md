# 🔐 **Entra Hybrid Cloud Integration**

This directory serves as the organizational hub for Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure AD) hybrid cloud documentation within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. It provides structured access to cloud identity integration, Azure services configuration, and hybrid authentication frameworks that bridge our on-premises infrastructure with Microsoft's cloud ecosystem.

## **📂 Overview**

The Entra hybrid cloud integration represents our enterprise-grade approach to extending Azure's control plane to on-premises infrastructure. This documentation category covers the strategic implementation of Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Arc integration, conditional access policies, and cloud service integrations that create a unified identity and governance framework across our research computing environment.

Our hybrid cloud strategy leverages Azure's enterprise identity services to provide consistent access controls, advanced security policies, and comprehensive governance without requiring full cloud migration of computational workloads. This approach enables us to maintain the performance benefits of on-premises research computing while gaining the security and management advantages of cloud-based identity services.

## **🎯 Strategic Context**

The Entra hybrid cloud integration supports several key organizational objectives:

### **Enterprise Identity Management**

Our implementation establishes a comprehensive identity framework that provides:

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** across all platform services
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** enforcement through conditional access
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with custom Azure roles aligned to our three-tier support model
- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** for administrative access governance

### **Zero Trust Architecture**

The hybrid cloud integration enables zero trust principles through:

- **Identity-centric security** with continuous verification
- **Conditional access policies** based on user, device, and location context
- **Network access controls** through secure remote access solutions
- **Compliance monitoring** and automated policy enforcement

### **Research Computing Optimization**

The hybrid approach provides enterprise governance while maintaining research performance:

- **On-premises compute** for performance-critical astronomical analysis workloads
- **Cloud-based identity and management** for governance and security
- **Hybrid storage** options for data lifecycle management
- **Scalable authentication** for external research collaborations
