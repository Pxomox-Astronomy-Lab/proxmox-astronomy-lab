# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-16 Application Security & Software Integrity Policy**

## **1. Purpose**

Ensuring **secure software development and deployment** is critical for **maintaining the integrity, security, and reliability of applications**. This policy defines **application security best practices, integrity verification processes, and secure deployment standards** for all internally and publicly released software within the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

## **2. Scope**

This policy applies to **all software development, containerized workloads, and infrastructure deployments**, covering:

- **Internal tools and scripts**
- **Publicly released code (e.g., GitHub repositories)**
- **Containerized applications and Kubernetes workloads**
- **Database and infrastructure components**

### **Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **secure application development and deployment** through:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Secure Software Development** | Applications follow secure coding guidelines and CIS-compliant configurations. |
| **Open Source Contributions** | Public releases on **GitHub**, with issue tracking and pull request acceptance. |
| **Artifact & Dependency Security** | Software components managed in **Snipe-IT and Azure Container Registry (ACR)**. |
| **Trusted Libraries & Dependencies** | Only well-known and vetted libraries used (e.g., **NASA Astronomy Libraries, Astropy**). |
| **Secure Deployment Pipelines** | Secure **Docker configurations, Helm charts, RKE2 Kubernetes deployment**. |
| **Development Isolation** | Dev workloads deployed in **a dedicated namespace on the K8s cluster**. |
| **Code Scanning & Security Audits** | GitHub **code scanning** enabled for **proxmox-astronomy-lab repo**. |

This policy aligns with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**, ensuring **secure and auditable software practices**.

---

## **3. Responsibilities**

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Secure CI/CD pipelines, manage container security, and monitor application compliance. |
| **Developers** | Follow secure coding guidelines, ensure dependency security, and conduct code reviews. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Monitor infrastructure security and enforce software integrity policies. |

---

## **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Secure Software Development & Release Management**

All software development follows **secure coding best practices** and is **reviewed before release**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Internal Development Baseline** | Established, in active development, no public GitHub releases yet. |
| **Public Releases** | All external-facing code hosted on **GitHub**, open to issues and pull requests. |
| **Version Control & Audits** | All configuration changes managed via **Git** for tracking and auditing. |

---

### **4.2 Artifact & Dependency Security**

Software components must be **tracked and securely managed**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Software Inventory Management** | **Snipe-IT** tracks vendors, applications, and services. |
| **Container Registry & SBOMs** | **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** manages containers, with built-in security scanning. |
| **Dependency Security** | Well-known, vetted libraries used (e.g., **Astropy, NASA Astronomy Libraries**). |

---

### **4.3 Secure Deployment & Infrastructure Protection**

All applications must be **deployed securely and follow compliance standards**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Secure Containers & Infrastructure** | Hardened **Docker configurations, Helm charts, and RKE2 Kubernetes** deployments. |
| **Data Security Standards** | **Database TLS connections, encryption at rest**. |
| **Development Environment Isolation** | **Dedicated K8s dev namespace** for testing before deployment. |

---

### **4.4 Secure Development Practices for Small Teams**

For small development teams within the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, secure coding and testing must be **streamlined and efficient**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Lightweight CI/CD Pipelines** | GitHub Actions for code builds and security testing. |
| **Static Code Analysis** | Automated security checks using **GitHub Code Scanning**. |
| **Manual Code Reviews** | Required for critical security-related updates. |

---

### **4.5 Application Security & External Reporting**

Publicly released code must **follow best security practices and be open for review**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Public API & Code Exposure** | Any released API hosted on **dedicated remote infrastructure**. |
| **Research & Astronomy Lab Code** | Publicly released, but assumed to run **internally within research labs**. |
| **Open Security Reporting** | Security vulnerabilities in public repositories **can be reported by external users**. |

---

### **4.6 Secure Authentication & Access Controls**

All application security must be **tied into Entra ID authentication**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Centralized Authentication** | Entra ID secures all lab-related access. |
| **Role-Based Access Control** | Developers and administrators have appropriate access based on role. |

---

### **4.7 Code Security Scanning & Continuous Monitoring**

All public repositories must have **automated security scanning enabled**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **GitHub Code Scanning** | Enabled for **proxmox-astronomy-lab repo** to detect security issues. |
| **CI/CD Security Checks** | GitHub Actions scan for vulnerabilities before merging. |
| **Continuous Security Reviews** | Security policies reviewed annually and adjusted based on emerging threats. |

---

## **5. Exception Handling**

Exceptions to this policy must be **requested in writing** and include:

- **Justification for the request**
- **Risk assessment of non-compliance**
- **Proposed alternative mitigations**
- **Technical challenges preventing compliance**
- **Planned review date for reevaluation**
