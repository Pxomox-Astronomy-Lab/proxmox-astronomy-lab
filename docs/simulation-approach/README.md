# **ITIL-Aligned Simulation Approach in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**

## **1. Overview**

The Proxmox Astronomy Lab employs a **structured simulation approach** to replicate enterprise IT Service Management (ITSM) practices within a citizen science environment. This approach allows a **single operator to experience and implement ITIL-based processes**, creating a realistic learning environment while maintaining rigorous operational standards.

Through the use of **GLPI as our ITIL-aligned service management platform**, we implement a practical subset of ITIL processes focused on infrastructure documentation, change management, and service operations.

### **Key Benefits:**

✅ **Experience key ITIL roles and responsibilities**
✅ **Practice service management processes in a controlled environment**
✅ **Create realistic documentation from multiple service perspectives**
✅ **Build enterprise-grade skills applicable to professional environments**
✅ **Test governance models without organizational complexity**

## **2. Simulation Philosophy**

Our simulation philosophy centers around the concept of a **"service management nexus"** - a multidisciplinary learning environment where ITIL principles and practices flow across various IT domains. The primary goal is to understand the interactions between roles rather than rigidly implementing every ITIL role.

| **Traditional ITIL Implementation** | **Proxmox Astronomy Lab Simulation** |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Multiple specialists in dedicated roles | Single operator rotating through functional role groups |
| Formal handoffs between teams | Direct experience of cross-functional workflows |
| Complex organizational hierarchy | Streamlined role structure covering key functions |
| Extensive documentation and governance | Practical documentation that serves learning objectives |

This approach creates a **balanced educational environment** that captures essential ITIL concepts while maintaining practicality for a single operator.

## **3. ITIL-Aligned Role Structure**

The lab implements a hybrid model where each primary simulation role encompasses several related ITIL roles based on natural functional groupings:

### **3.1 Primary Roles and ITIL Equivalents**

| **Simulation Role** | **Encompasses ITIL Roles** | **Primary Responsibilities** |
|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Lab Owner** | IT Steering Group (ISG), Service Portfolio Manager, Financial Manager, Service Strategy Manager | Strategic direction, service portfolio decisions, budgeting, prioritization, resource allocation |
| **Engineer** | Enterprise Architect, Technical Analyst, Application Developer, Service Design Manager | Infrastructure design, service architecture, technical implementation, capacity planning |
| **Operations** | IT Operations Manager, Problem Manager, Service Level Manager, Availability Manager, Incident Manager | Day-to-day operations, monitoring, stability, incident & problem management, SLA oversight |
| **Security Administrator** | Information Security Manager, Access Manager, Compliance Manager, Risk Manager | Security controls, compliance verification, risk management, access management |
| **Service Desk** | 1st Level Support, Service Request Fulfillment, Knowledge Manager, Service Catalog Manager | User support, service requests, knowledge articles, user communication |
| **Change Management** | Change Manager, Change Advisory Board, Release Manager, Configuration Manager | Change control, release coordination, configuration management |
| **Continuous Improvement** | CSI Manager, Process Owner, Process Architect, Service Owner | Service improvements, process refinement, service ownership |

### **3.2 Role Rotation Schedule**

To maintain the simulation's effectiveness, roles are rotated according to:

- **Process-Based Rotation** - Different roles engage based on the ITIL process being executed
- **Service Lifecycle Focus** - Rotations follow the natural ITIL service lifecycle stages
- **Issue-Based Assignment** - Specific issues trigger involvement from appropriate roles

This ensures comprehensive coverage of ITIL practices while maintaining practicality.
