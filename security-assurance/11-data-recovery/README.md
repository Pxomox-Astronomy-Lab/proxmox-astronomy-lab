# üíæ **CIS Control 11: Data Recovery**

## üîç **1. Introduction**

CIS Control 11 forms a critical component of our business continuity strategy, providing a structured framework for ensuring data resilience through comprehensive backup and recovery mechanisms. This control ensures that critical information assets remain available and protected even in the event of system failures or security incidents.

Data recovery is **critical for maintaining business continuity** in the event of **cybersecurity incidents, hardware failures, or natural disasters**. **CIS Control 11** mandates a structured approach to **data backup, encryption, retention, and recovery testing** to ensure that essential data remains **secure and recoverable**.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** employs a **multi-tiered backup strategy** to ensure compliance with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

The following table outlines our key data recovery components and their implementation:

| **Key Data Recovery Features** | **Implementation** |
|-------------------------------|------------------|
| **Automated Daily Backups** | All critical data is backed up daily with a **14-day retention period**. |
| **Offsite Backup Redundancy** | Weekly and monthly backups stored securely in **Wasabi cloud storage**. |
| **Backup Encryption** | AES-256 encryption applied to all stored backups. |
| **Quarterly Recovery Testing** | Windows & Linux VMs restored every **3 months** to verify recoverability. |
| **Strict Access Controls** | Backup files are **access-restricted and monitored** for integrity. |

This integrated approach ensures both the security and availability of backup data throughout its lifecycle.

## üéØ **2. Scope**

This control applies to all critical data assets within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab environment with specific implementation requirements based on data classification and business impact. Clear definition of scope ensures appropriate coverage while acknowledging practical limitations.

The following table outlines the scope boundaries for our data recovery implementation:

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | All backups of critical lab data, including servers, applications, and user files. |
| **Out-of-Scope** | Temporary files, non-critical test environments. |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 11, NIST 800-53 (CP-9), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.12.3). |

This defined scope ensures that backup resources are focused on protecting the most valuable data assets while maintaining compliance with applicable frameworks.

## üîÑ **3. Data Recovery Implementation**

### **3.1 Backup & Storage Strategy**

Our backup strategy focuses on automation, redundancy, and security to ensure data availability while protecting sensitive information. This multi-layered approach addresses both availability and confidentiality requirements.

The following table details our backup and storage implementation:

| **Security Measure** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Backup Frequency** | Daily backups with a **14-day retention period**. |
| **Offsite Storage** | Weekly & monthly backups stored securely in Wasabi. |
| **Backup Encryption** | AES-256 encryption applied to all backup data. |
| **Access Controls** | Only authorized personnel can access or restore data. |

This combination of frequent backups, secure storage, and strict access controls ensures comprehensive protection of critical data assets.

### **3.2 Recovery Testing & Incident Response**

Regular testing validates the effectiveness of our backup strategy and ensures readiness for actual recovery scenarios. Our structured approach to testing builds confidence in recovery capabilities while identifying potential issues proactively.

The following table outlines our testing and response implementation:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Quarterly Recovery Tests** | Windows & Linux VMs restored every 3 months. |
| **Disaster Recovery Drills** | Simulated recovery scenarios tested annually. |
| **Incident-Based Recovery** | Prioritized recovery based on impact analysis. |

These testing activities provide assurance that recovery procedures will function as expected when needed.

### **3.3 Backup Security & Monitoring**

Protecting backup data is as important as protecting production systems. Our approach implements multiple safeguards to ensure backup integrity and confidentiality.

The following table outlines our backup security implementation:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Data Integrity Checks** | Automated integrity verification during backup creation. |
| **Backup Isolation** | Offsite backups **not directly accessible from production systems**. |
| **Retention & Disposal** | Secure deletion policies apply to expired backups. |

These security measures ensure that backup data remains protected throughout its lifecycle while maintaining accessibility for legitimate recovery operations.

## üìä **4. Compliance Evidence**

Maintaining evidence of control implementation is essential for demonstrating compliance and ensuring continued effectiveness. Our documentation provides comprehensive coverage of each sub-control's implementation.

The following table maps CIS Control 11 sub-controls to our implementation documentation:

| **Control** | **Implementation Details** | **Reference Document** |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **11.1** | Secure, encrypted backups created daily. | [CISv8 11.1 Implementation](./11.1.md) |
| **11.2** | Offsite backup redundancy with secure access controls. | [CISv8 11.2 Implementation](./11.2.md) |
| **11.3** | Regular recovery testing to ensure backup integrity. | [CISv8 11.3 Implementation](./11.3.md) |
| **11.4** | Role-based access control for all backup files. | [CISv8 11.4 Compliance](./11.4.md) |

This structured documentation approach ensures that all aspects of the control are properly addressed and verified through regular assessment.
