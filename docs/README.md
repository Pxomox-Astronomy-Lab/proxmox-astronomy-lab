# üñ•Ô∏è **Applications & Services**

## üîç **1. Overview**

The **Applications & Services** section documents all **deployed software systems** within the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** environment. This includes **containerized applications, databases, supporting services, and research tools** that collectively enable the lab's IT operations and scientific research capabilities.

Each application is documented with a consistent approach covering **technical architecture, configuration details, access management, and operational procedures** to ensure proper maintenance and support throughout its lifecycle.

---

## üìä **2. Application Categories**

The lab's applications are organized into functional categories that reflect their purpose and technical characteristics. Each category has its own dedicated documentation section.

## üîß **3. Deployment Architecture**

### **3.1 Deployment Strategy**

The lab employs a structured deployment approach that ensures all applications are properly containerized, monitored, and secured:

- **Containerized by default** - Applications are deployed using Docker and Kubernetes
- **Configuration as code** - All application configurations are version-controlled
- **Standardized monitoring** - Prometheus and Loki integration is mandatory
- **Consistent security baselines** - Security controls are applied to all applications

### **3.2 Primary Application Hosts**

| **Host** | **Purpose** | **Primary Applications** |
|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| **lab-apps01** | Lab-wide applications | Gitea, Nextcloud, Vaultwarden |
| **lab-db01** | Database systems | PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, MariaDB, Redis |
| **lab-port01** | Container management | Portainer |
| **proj-apps01** | Project-specific applications | Apache Superset, MLflow, Airflow |
| **Kubernetes cluster** | Scalable workloads | Milvus, TensorFlow, processing pipelines |
| **proj-rds02** | Radio astronomy workstation | GNU Radio, SigDigger, SDR++ |

## üîÑ **4. Application Lifecycle Management**

### **4.1 Deployment Process**

All applications in the lab follow a structured deployment process:

1. **Containerization** - Applications are packaged in Docker containers
2. **Review & Testing** - Security and functionality testing in isolated environments
3. **Deployment** - Managed via Portainer, Kubernetes, or dedicated Ansible playbooks
4. **Monitoring Integration** - Exporters and agents are deployed with the application
5. **Documentation** - Service documentation is created or updated in this wiki

### **4.2 Maintenance & Updates**

| **Activity** | **Frequency** | **Responsibility** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Security Patching** | Monthly or as required | Engineer | [Patch Management](../ITIL-Processes/Change-Management/Patch-Management.md) |
| **Version Upgrades** | As needed | Engineer | [Application Upgrades](../ITIL-Processes/Change-Management/Application-Upgrades.md) |
| **Configuration Reviews** | Quarterly | Operations | [Configuration Reviews](../ITIL-Processes/Problem-Management/Configuration-Reviews.md) |
| **Backup Verification** | Monthly | Operations | [Backup Verification](../ITIL-Processes/Service-Catalog/Backup-Verification.md) |

---

## üîê **5. Security & Access Management**

### **5.1 Access Control**

The lab follows a consistent approach to application access control:

- **Centralized authentication** - Zitadel for identity management
- **Role-based access control** - Permissions assigned based on user roles
- **Multi-factor authentication** - Required for all administrative access
- **Access reviews** - Regular review of user accounts and permissions

### **5.2 Security Monitoring**

All applications are subject to security monitoring via:

- **Wazuh SIEM** - Security event monitoring and alerting
- **Log analysis** - Centralized logging in Loki with security alerting
- **Vulnerability scanning** - Regular assessment of application security
- **Configuration compliance** - Automated verification against security baselines

## üöÄ **6. Getting Started**

### **6.1 New Application Onboarding**

To add a new application to the lab environment:

1. Review the [Application Onboarding Guide](../ITIL-Processes/Change-Management/Application-Onboarding.md)
2. Submit a change request following the [RFC Template](../ITIL-Processes/Change-Management/RFC-Templates/RFC-Template.md)
3. Ensure the application meets security requirements detailed in [Application Security Standards](../Compliance-Security/Security-Policies/Application-Security-Standards.md)
4. Document the application following templates in [Documentation Standards](../Documentation-Standards/Templates/Service-Documentation/index.md)

### **6.2 Documentation Navigation**

For efficient navigation of application documentation:

1. Start with the category index to identify relevant services
2. Review application-specific pages for detailed technical information
3. Reference related operational procedures in the [ITIL Processes](../ITIL-Processes/index.md) section
4. Check security-related requirements in the [Compliance & Security](../Compliance-Security/index.md) section
