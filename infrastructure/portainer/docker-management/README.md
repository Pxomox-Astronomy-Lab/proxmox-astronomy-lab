# 🐳 **Docker Container Management via Portainer**

Enterprise-grade Docker container management through Portainer's web interface, providing comprehensive orchestration capabilities for the Proxmox Astronomy Lab's hybrid infrastructure. This directory contains documentation and procedures for managing Docker containers across the 7-node cluster through Portainer's centralized management platform.

## **Overview**

Docker container management via Portainer represents the foundational layer of our containerized infrastructure strategy within the hybrid Kubernetes and VM architecture. Portainer provides enterprise-grade web-based management for Docker environments deployed across management and project VMs, enabling efficient container lifecycle management, resource monitoring, and deployment automation for astronomical computing workloads.

The Docker management layer integrates seamlessly with our RKE2 Kubernetes infrastructure while maintaining dedicated Docker environments for specialized services that benefit from direct container management. This approach supports both rapid development workflows and production-grade service deployment across our research computing platform.

## **Getting Started**

For new users approaching Docker container management via Portainer:

1. **Start Here:** [Portainer Main Documentation](../README.md) - Understanding the overall Portainer ecosystem
2. **Access Setup:** [Security & RBAC Guide](../security-rbac/README.md) - Configuring user access and permissions
3. **First Deployment:** Container Lifecycle Procedures (pending) - Step-by-step container deployment
4. **Advanced Operations:** Image Management and Template Usage - Leveraging enterprise deployment patterns

---

## **🎯 Enterprise Integration**

### **Infrastructure Context**

Docker container management via Portainer operates within our 7-node Proxmox cluster architecture, specifically managing containers on:

- **mgmt-docker01** (8GB RAM, 6 vCPU) - Primary Docker management node
- **proj-dev01** (4GB RAM, 4 vCPU) - Development container environment
- **proj-dp01** (2GB RAM, 4 vCPU) - Data processing container services

### **Production Workloads**

Current Docker-managed services supporting astronomical research:

- **PostgreSQL databases** for DESI cosmic void analysis (30GB+ datasets)
- **Development environments** for quasar outflow modeling and AGN research  
- **Data processing pipelines** for spectral analysis and anomaly detection
- **Monitoring stack components** integrated with mon01 observability infrastructure

### **Hybrid Architecture Benefits**

Docker management via Portainer complements our RKE2 Kubernetes infrastructure by providing:

- **Simplified deployment** for single-node services and development environments
- **Direct container access** for debugging and troubleshooting workflows
- **Resource isolation** for compute-intensive astronomical analysis tasks
- **Rapid prototyping** capabilities for new research software and algorithms
