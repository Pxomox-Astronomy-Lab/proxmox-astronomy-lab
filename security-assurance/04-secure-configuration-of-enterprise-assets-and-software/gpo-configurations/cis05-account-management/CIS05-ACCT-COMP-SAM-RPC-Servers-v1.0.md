# üîê **CIS05-ACCT-COMP-SAM-RPC-Servers-v1.0**

This Group Policy Object implements Security Account Manager Remote Procedure Call blocking requirements specifically for Member Servers within the Windows Server 2025 Active Directory environment. The GPO blocks all SAM change password RPC methods on Member Servers to prevent unauthorized password modification attempts through legacy interfaces and strengthen overall domain security posture across server infrastructure components.

The policy configuration implements CIS Control 5 (Account and Credential Management) requirements by establishing comprehensive SAM RPC blocking for Member Servers, ensuring that password change operations cannot be performed through potentially vulnerable remote procedure call interfaces, thereby reducing attack surface and enforcing secure password management practices throughout the domain infrastructure.

# üîó **2. Dependencies & Relationships**

This section maps how the SAM RPC Member Servers policy GPO integrates with Proxmox Astronomy Lab Member Server security infrastructure and enterprise credential protection components.

## **2.1 Related Services**

This subsection identifies Proxmox Astronomy Lab services that interact with or depend on SAM RPC blocking protection for comprehensive Member Server security and credential management.

## **3.3 Implementation Standards**

This subsection establishes technical standards for SAM RPC Member Servers policy deployment and enterprise security management.

SAM RPC Member Servers policy implementation follows systematic deployment standards and operational procedures:

- **Deployment Method**: Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) with Member Servers organizational unit targeting
- **Target Scope**: Member Servers with SAM RPC password change operations
- **Testing Protocol**: Controlled implementation through test Member Servers with blocking validation
- **Monitoring Integration**: SAM RPC security event logging with blocking operation correlation
- **Documentation Standard**: Complete configuration mapping with CIS control references and blocking validation procedures

# üõ†Ô∏è **4. Implementation & Usage**

This section provides systematic guidance for implementing SAM RPC Member Servers policy configuration and establishing security protection across Member Server infrastructure.

## **4.1 Prerequisites**

This subsection identifies requirements for successful SAM RPC Member Servers policy implementation within Active Directory Member Server infrastructure.

SAM RPC Member Servers policy implementation requires enterprise Member Server infrastructure with appropriate administrative access and comprehensive security management capabilities:

- **Member Server Infrastructure**: Windows Server 2025 Member Servers with Group Policy application capability
- **Administrative Access**: Domain Admin or equivalent Group Policy management permissions for Member Server security policy configuration
- **Security Infrastructure**: Established security protocols and monitoring capabilities
- **Testing Environment**: Isolated Member Servers for controlled policy testing and blocking validation
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Security event monitoring capabilities for SAM RPC operation tracking and blocking status validation

## **4.2 Monitoring**

This subsection establishes monitoring requirements for SAM RPC Member Servers policy effectiveness and security validation across Member Server infrastructure.

SAM RPC Member Servers monitoring leverages the centralized monitoring stack on proj-mon01 (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, AlertManager, Grafana Alloy) for systematic security protection tracking and Member Server security event analysis. The monitoring philosophy of "if it can be collected, we do" applies to SAM RPC blocking status, password change operation prevention, and policy enforcement effectiveness measurement through centralized security monitoring infrastructure.

Monitoring includes SAM RPC blocking correlation, Member Server security event tracking, and compliance validation through comprehensive Member Server security monitoring and automated alerting for unauthorized SAM operations or policy violations.

# üîê **5. Security & Compliance**

This section establishes security framework alignment and compliance requirements for SAM RPC Member Servers policy configuration within enterprise security architecture.

## **5.1 Security Framework Alignment**

This subsection maps SAM RPC Member Servers policy configuration to enterprise security frameworks and compliance requirements for systematic security protection.

**Security Disclaimer**: The SAM RPC Member Servers policy configuration documented in this guide represents a security baseline establishment for Windows Server 2025 Active Directory Member Server infrastructure. These configurations should be thoroughly tested in non-production environments before deployment. While these templates follow CIS Controls v8 security framework guidelines, organizations should validate policy compatibility with their specific Member Server operational requirements and business operational needs. The security research computing team maintains these configurations as implementation guidance rather than production security recommendations, and encourages consultation with dedicated security professionals for enterprise deployment validation.

### **Framework Mapping**

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** | **Implementation Evidence** |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **CIS Controls v8** | Control 5: Account and Credential Management | SAM RPC Member Servers policy implementing security protection for credential operations |
| **NIST AI RMF** | GOVERN-1.1: AI governance processes established | Security protection supports AI workload Member Server authentication and access control |
| **NIST CSF 2.0** | PR.AC-4: Access permissions and authorizations are managed | Systematic SAM RPC blocking enforcement and credential access control |
| **NIST SP 800-171** | 3.1.1: Limit information system access to authorized users | Comprehensive blocking requirements for Member Server credential operations |

### **Security Controls Implementation**

| **CIS Control** | **SAM RPC Member Servers Implementation** | **Security Objective** |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **5.1** | Complete RPC Blocking | Protect Member Server password operations through systematic interface blocking |

## **5.2 Compliance Requirements**

This subsection establishes compliance validation requirements and evidence collection standards for SAM RPC Member Servers policy implementation.

SAM RPC Member Servers policy configuration enables systematic compliance evidence collection through Group Policy Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) reporting and security validation. Compliance validation requires regular policy application assessment and blocking monitoring to maintain baseline security posture across Member Server infrastructure components.

# üìã **6. Backup & Recovery**

This section establishes protection and recovery procedures for SAM RPC Member Servers policy configuration and security baseline preservation.

## **6.1 Protection Strategy**
