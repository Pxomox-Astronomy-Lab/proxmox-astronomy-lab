# 📊 **Infrastructure Diagrams**

This directory contains comprehensive visual documentation of the Proxmox Astronomy Lab infrastructure architecture, providing essential diagrams that illustrate network topology, system relationships, and architectural patterns across the enterprise astronomical computing platform. These visual resources support infrastructure understanding, operational planning, and architectural decision-making for the 7-node hybrid cluster environment.

## **Overview**

The infrastructure diagrams serve as critical visual documentation for understanding the complex relationships within our enterprise-grade astronomical computing platform. These diagrams provide clear visualization of network topology, hardware interconnections, and service relationships across our hybrid RKE2 Kubernetes and strategic VM architecture. Each diagram represents current production infrastructure and supports both operational understanding and strategic planning activities.

The visual documentation encompasses network layer diagrams showing VLAN segmentation and traffic flow, hardware topology illustrating physical node relationships and storage architecture, and logical service diagrams demonstrating application dependencies and data flow patterns. These resources enable effective infrastructure communication across technical teams while supporting troubleshooting, capacity planning, and architectural evolution activities.
