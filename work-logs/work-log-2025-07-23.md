### **Infrastructure Automation Worklog: Ansible Foundation & Centralized Operations**

* **Date Range:** Monday, July 22, 2025 â€“ Tuesday, July 23, 2025
* **Engineer:** crainbramp  
* **Project:** Proxmox Astronomy Lab (P/AL) - Infrastructure Automation Initiative

## 1. Executive Summary

This initiative established a comprehensive infrastructure automation and centralized operations foundation for the P/AL cluster. The work focused on deploying Ansible-based configuration management, implementing fleet-wide logging aggregation, and establishing comprehensive monitoring coverage across all Linux assets. The resulting architecture provides systematic, auditable automation capabilities and centralized operational visibility that scales efficiently across the 20+ VM infrastructure.

## 2. Key Workstreams and Accomplishments

### Workstream 1: Ansible Infrastructure Automation Framework

* **Goal:** Establish a scalable, modular configuration management system for systematic fleet operations.
* **Actions Performed:**
  1. **Foundation Architecture:** Designed and implemented a KISS-principle Ansible framework with proper role separation and extensible directory structure.
  2. **Configuration Management Resolution:** Resolved ansible.cfg role path conflicts and established standardized execution patterns suitable for both manual and automated agent operations.
  3. **Fleet-wide Baseline Deployment:** Successfully deployed foundational security and operational baselines to **20 Linux hosts** including:
     * **Time Synchronization:** Chrony NTP configuration using US pool servers
     * **Automated Patching:** Unattended-upgrades scheduled for weekday 11 AM (post-backup window)
     * **DNS Resolution:** Complete .radioastronomy.io hosts file management
     * **SSH Hardening:** Root login disabled, key-based authentication enforced

* **Strategic Impact:** This workstream established the foundational automation capability, enabling systematic, auditable configuration management across the entire Linux fleet with atomic, idempotent operations.

### Workstream 2: Centralized Logging Infrastructure Deployment

* **Goal:** Implement comprehensive log aggregation for operational visibility and security monitoring across all infrastructure assets.
* **Actions Performed:**
  1. **Agent Deployment Strategy:** Deployed Grafana Alloy logging agents fleet-wide, resolving repository conflicts through direct package installation methodology.
  2. **SystemD Integration:** Configured journal log collection with proper permissions (systemd-journal group membership) enabling comprehensive system event visibility.
  3. **Container Logging:** Established Docker container log collection for containerized workloads across project hosts.
  4. **Centralized Collection:** Successfully established log aggregation to proj-mon01 with **15+ hosts actively streaming** system and application logs to Loki.

* **Strategic Impact:** This deployment provides centralized operational visibility and establishes the logging foundation required for security operations, troubleshooting, and compliance monitoring.

### Workstream 3: Comprehensive Monitoring Infrastructure

* **Goal:** Deploy systematic metrics collection and monitoring coverage across all infrastructure components.
* **Actions Performed:**
  1. **Prometheus Configuration:** Implemented templated Prometheus configuration with comprehensive service discovery covering all infrastructure exporters.
  2. **Multi-Tier Monitoring:** Established monitoring for **60+ targets** across multiple layers:
     * **System Level:** Node exporters on all Linux hosts
     * **Container Level:** cAdvisor for Docker environments  
     * **Application Level:** PostgreSQL, GPU, and specialized service exporters
     * **Infrastructure Level:** What's Up Docker (WUD) for container lifecycle monitoring
  3. **Labeling Strategy:** Implemented consistent hostname and group-based labeling for organized metric collection and alerting.

* **Strategic Impact:** This monitoring deployment provides comprehensive infrastructure visibility and establishes the metrics foundation for performance management, capacity planning, and operational alerting.

## 3. Technical Challenges and Resolutions

* **Repository Conflicts:** Resolved GPG key conflicts by implementing direct .deb package installation methodology for Alloy agents
* **Configuration Syntax:** Addressed River configuration parsing by eliminating unsupported comment formats (# vs //)
* **Permission Management:** Resolved Alloy service permissions through proper group membership configuration
* **Data Integrity:** Performed Loki data cleanup to resolve label conflicts from previous configurations
* **Execution Reliability:** Eliminated problematic Ansible callbacks that interfered with fleet-wide operations

## 4. Infrastructure Status and Metrics

The initiative successfully established automation and monitoring across the complete Linux infrastructure:

* **Managed Assets:** 20 Linux VMs under Ansible management (excluding mgmt-ansible01 control node)
* **Logging Coverage:** 15+ hosts actively streaming logs to centralized Loki instance
* **Monitoring Coverage:** 60+ Prometheus targets across system, container, database, and application layers
* **Network Architecture:** Dual-VLAN design (10.25.10.x management, 10.25.20.x project) with complete DNS resolution

## 5. Delivered Capabilities and Next Steps

This initiative established the foundational automation and operations infrastructure required for systematic fleet management and operational visibility.

### **Immediate Priorities**

1. **Complete Monitoring Stack Deployment:**
   * **Objective:** Deploy Prometheus and Grafana to operationalize the metrics collection infrastructure
   * **Scope:** Configure alerting rules, operational dashboards, and performance monitoring

2. **Expand Automation Coverage:**
   * **Objective:** Extend Ansible role coverage to additional operational areas
   * **Scope:** DNS services, enhanced security hardening, and application-specific configurations

3. **Agent Integration Testing:**
   * **Objective:** Validate the automation framework for AI agent execution scenarios
   * **Scope:** MCP server deployment and automated task execution validation

The completed foundation provides enterprise-grade automation capabilities with centralized logging and comprehensive monitoring, establishing the operational infrastructure required for systematic fleet management and security operations.
