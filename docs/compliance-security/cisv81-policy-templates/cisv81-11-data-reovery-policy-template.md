# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-11 Data Recovery Policy Template**

## **1. Overview**  

### **Why This Policy Matters**  

A structured **data recovery policy** is essential to ensure that **critical data remains protected, backed up, and recoverable** in case of an incident. Whether from **cyber threats, hardware failures, or natural disasters**, organizations must have a **documented and tested plan** to recover lost data efficiently.

### **Key Aspects of This Policy:**  

âœ… **Defines structured data backup and recovery processes.**  
âœ… **Ensures that backups are securely stored and protected from tampering.**  
âœ… **Requires periodic data recovery testing to validate readiness.**  
âœ… **Supports compliance with industry regulations and best practices.**  

This document **presents the CISv8 Data Recovery Policy Template** and includes **additional information on how organizations may implement it**, along with a **generalized example of its application in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

## **3. CISv8 Data Recovery Policy Template**  

```markdown
# Data Recovery Policy Template  

## **Purpose**  
Proper planning helps an enterprise recover from cybersecurity incidents or disasters **in a timely and controlled manner**. The **Data Recovery Policy** defines the **backup, protection, and recovery** of enterprise data to ensure that it remains **secure and available**.  

---

## **Responsibility**  
- **IT is responsible** for implementing and managing backup solutions, ensuring encryption, and conducting recovery tests.  
- **Administrators must verify** that backups are successfully completed, retention policies are followed, and recoverability tests are performed.  
- **Users are responsible** for ensuring that enterprise data is stored in **approved locations** to facilitate backup coverage.  

---

## **Policy**  

### **4.1 Data Recovery Planning**  
1. **A formal data recovery process must be documented and maintained**.  
2. **The process must be reviewed annually** or after major infrastructure changes.  
3. **IT must identify all data that requires backup**, ensuring:  
   - Business-critical and sensitive data is properly classified.  
   - Cloud service provider backup mechanisms are considered.  

---

### **4.2 Backup Strategy & Execution**  
1. **Data must be backed up using automated tools** at least weekly, or more frequently as required.  
2. **Retention policies must align with the Data Management Policy**.  
3. **Offsite backups must be maintained** and **must not be directly accessible from a network**.  
4. **Backups must be protected from unauthorized access** using encryption and strict access controls.  

---

### **4.3 Backup Encryption & Security**  
1. **All backups must be encrypted using AES-256 or equivalent standards**.  
2. **Access to backups must be restricted to authorized personnel only**.  
3. **Encryption keys must be managed securely** through enterprise key management systems.  

---

### **4.4 Data Recovery Testing**  
1. **Quarterly recovery tests must be performed** to validate backup integrity.  
2. **Tests must include restoring a Windows and Linux VM** to verify system recoverability.  
3. **Annual disaster recovery simulations must be conducted** to ensure preparedness.  
4. **All test results must be documented, and corrective actions taken if failures occur**.  

---

### **4.5 Incident Response & Data Restoration**  
1. **IT must follow the Data Recovery Plan** in case of an incident.  
2. **Critical systems must be restored first**, based on impact analysis.  
3. **System integrity must be verified during the recovery process**.  
4. **Users and stakeholders must be informed of recovery status and timeline**.  

```

---

## **4. Best Practices for Implementing This Policy**  

Organizations implementing **CIS Control 11 â€“ Data Recovery** should consider the following best practices:  

- **Follow the 3-2-1 Backup Rule** â€“ Keep **3 copies of data**, stored on **2 different media**, with **1 copy offsite**.  
- **Ensure Immutable Backups** â€“ Prevent **ransomware from encrypting or modifying backups** by using **immutable storage**.  
- **Automate Backup Monitoring** â€“ Ensure **alerts are triggered for failed backup jobs**.  
- **Test Recoverability Regularly** â€“ **Quarterly restore tests ensure backups are valid and accessible**.  
- **Use Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)** â€“ Restrict access to backup systems to **authorized personnel only**.  

These strategies ensure **a structured, automated, and resilient data recovery process**.

## **5. Example Implementation in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**  

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, CIS Control 11 is implemented with the following measures:  

### **5.1 Backup Strategy & Retention**  

âœ… **Daily backups with a 14-day retention period for active data.**  
âœ… **Weekly full backups and a monthly archive stored offsite in Wasabi Cloud.**  
âœ… **AES-256 encryption applied to all backup data.**  

### **5.2 Recovery Testing & Incident Response**  

âœ… **Quarterly restore tests validate Windows and Linux VM backups.**  
âœ… **Annual disaster recovery simulations ensure critical system availability.**  
âœ… **Backup logs are monitored to detect failures or anomalies.**  

### **5.3 Secure Backup Storage & Access Controls**  

âœ… **Backups stored in a separate, access-controlled partition.**  
âœ… **Offsite backups are kept in an air-gapped storage environment.**  
âœ… **Access to backup data is restricted using enterprise key management policies.**

## **6. Summary and Next Steps**  

âœ… **This document presents the official CISv8 Data Recovery Policy Template.**  
âœ… **It includes additional information on possible solutions for implementation.**  
âœ… **A high-level example from the Proxmox Astronomy Lab is provided for reference.**  

ðŸ“Œ **Actionable Next Steps:**  

- **Ensure automated backups are configured and actively monitored.**  
- **Implement encryption and access controls to protect backup data.**  
- **Perform quarterly recovery tests to validate data integrity.**  

ðŸš€ **By following this framework, organizations can ensure structured, secure, and auditable data recovery processes.**
