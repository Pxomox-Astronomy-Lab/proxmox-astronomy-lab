# **üîç CISv8 Vulnerability Management Policy Template**

## **1. Overview**  

### **Why This Policy Matters**  

Vulnerability management is a **proactive approach to identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating security flaws** in software, hardware, and configurations. Regular vulnerability scanning, timely patching, and security hardening are **critical components** of a strong cybersecurity framework.

Key aspects of this policy include:  

‚úÖ **Regular scanning for vulnerabilities in enterprise systems.**  
‚úÖ **Risk-based prioritization of security flaws using industry standards.**  
‚úÖ **Timely patching and mitigation strategies to minimize exposure.**  
‚úÖ **Continuous monitoring and reporting to ensure compliance.**  

This document **presents the CISv8 Vulnerability Management Policy Template** and includes **additional information on how organizations may implement it**, along with a **generalized example of its application in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

## **3. CISv8 Vulnerability Management Policy Template**  

```markdown
# Vulnerability Management Policy Template  

## **Purpose**  
Vulnerability management is the process of **searching for, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities** in enterprise systems and software. This policy ensures:  
- **All systems undergo regular vulnerability assessments.**  
- **Critical vulnerabilities are addressed promptly to minimize risk.**  
- **Patching and remediation procedures are documented and enforced.**  

---

## **Responsibility**  
- **IT security teams are responsible** for performing vulnerability assessments.  
- **System administrators are responsible** for patching and remediating vulnerabilities.  
- **Users must apply software updates and adhere to security requirements.**  

---

## **Policy**  

### **7.1 Vulnerability Assessment & Monitoring**  
1. **A documented vulnerability management process must be maintained and reviewed annually.**  
2. **IT security teams must continuously monitor threat intelligence sources.**  
3. **All enterprise systems must undergo periodic vulnerability scans.**  

---

### **7.2 Prioritization of Vulnerabilities**  
1. **Vulnerabilities must be assessed based on severity and potential impact.**  
2. **High-risk vulnerabilities (CVSS ‚â• 7.0) must be remediated within strict SLAs.**  
3. **Mitigating controls must be applied if immediate remediation is not feasible.**  

---

### **7.3 Patch Management & Remediation**  
1. **All operating systems must be configured for automatic updates, unless otherwise documented.**  
2. **Security patches must be applied in accordance with defined risk levels.**  
3. **Systems requiring manual updates must follow an approved patching schedule.**  

---

### **7.4 Continuous Monitoring & Reporting**  
1. **All vulnerability scan results must be logged and reviewed.**  
2. **A monthly security report must be generated to track remediation efforts.**  
3. **Unpatched vulnerabilities must be escalated to decision-makers.**  

```

## **4. Best Practices for Implementing This Policy**  

Organizations implementing **CIS Control 7 ‚Äì Vulnerability Management** should consider:  

- **Automating vulnerability scanning** with tools like a SIEM.  
- **Using risk-based prioritization** (CVSS scoring, exploitability ratings) to determine remediation timelines.  
- **Implementing a structured patch management process** to ensure timely updates.  
- **Monitoring real-time threat intelligence feeds**, such as **CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)**.  

By integrating these **best practices**, organizations can effectively **reduce exposure to cyber threats** while maintaining **compliance with security standards**.

## **5. Example Implementation in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**  

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, **CIS Control 7** is implemented through the following methods:

### **5.1 Vulnerability Scanning & Threat Intelligence**  

‚úÖ **Daily vulnerability scans using Wazuh SEIM.**  
‚úÖ **Weekly review of the CISA KEV catalog for emerging threats.**  
‚úÖ **Automated security compliance checks via OSQuery and Microsoft Sentinel via Azure Arc.**  

### **5.2 Risk-Based Prioritization & Patching**  

‚úÖ **Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS 9.0+) patched within 72 hours.**  
‚úÖ **High vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0-8.9) patched within 5 business days.**  
‚úÖ **Mitigating controls applied when immediate patching is not possible.**  

### **5.3 Continuous Monitoring & Compliance Reporting**  

‚úÖ **All vulnerability scan logs are centralized in Wazuh SIEM.**  
‚úÖ **Patch compliance is tracked via Ansible automation.**  
‚úÖ **Weekly reports summarize remediation efforts and outstanding risks.**

## **6. Summary and Next Steps**  

‚úÖ **This document presents the official CISv8 Vulnerability Management Policy Template.**  
‚úÖ **It includes additional information on possible implementation strategies.**  
‚úÖ **A high-level example from the Proxmox Astronomy Lab is provided for reference.**  

üìå **Actionable Next Steps:**  

- **Ensure all critical vulnerabilities are patched within SLA-defined timelines.**  
- **Automate vulnerability scanning and threat intelligence monitoring.**  
- **Establish a structured reporting system to track remediation efforts.**  

üöÄ **By following this framework, organizations can systematically detect, prioritize, and mitigate vulnerabilities, reducing their attack surface and improving security resilience.**
