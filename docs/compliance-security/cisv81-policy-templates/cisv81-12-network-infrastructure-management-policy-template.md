# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-12 Network Infrastructure Management Policy Template**

## **1. Overview**  

### **Why This Policy Matters**  

A **secure and well-managed network infrastructure** is essential for protecting **enterprise assets, enforcing Zero Trust principles, and preventing unauthorized access**. The **CISv8 Network Infrastructure Management Policy** provides guidance on configuring, securing, and maintaining network assets such as **firewalls, routers, switches, and VPNs**.

### **Key Aspects of This Policy:**  

âœ… **Ensures all network devices are securely configured and maintained.**  
âœ… **Defines strict firewall rules, segmentation policies, and access controls.**  
âœ… **Enforces centralized logging and monitoring of network activity.**  
âœ… **Supports compliance with industry security standards and best practices.**  

This document **presents the CISv8 Network Infrastructure Management Policy Template** and includes **additional information on how organizations may implement it**, along with a **generalized example of its application in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

## **3. CISv8 Network Infrastructure Management Policy Template**  

```markdown
# Network Infrastructure Management Policy Template  

## **Purpose**  
The **Network Infrastructure Management Policy** ensures that all enterprise network devices and configurations follow **security best practices** to protect **against unauthorized access, malware, and misconfigurations**.  

---

## **Responsibility**  
- **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** are responsible for **configuring, securing, and maintaining** network devices.  
- **Administrators must enforce security policies**, including **firewall rules and access control policies**.  
- **Users must comply with security guidelines** and report any unauthorized network activity.  

---

## **Policy**  

### **4.1 Network Security & Access Controls**  
1. **Network devices must follow vendor hardening guidelines or industry standards (e.g., CIS Benchmarks).**  
2. **All network traffic must be encrypted** (TLS 1.3, SSH, or VPN encryption).  
3. **All externally accessible services must require MFA and access control enforcement.**  
4. **No insecure protocols (e.g., Telnet, FTP, SMBv1) should be allowed.**  
5. **All firewall configurations must enforce a default-deny inbound policy.**  

---

### **4.2 Firewall & Traffic Security**  
1. **All firewalls must be configured to enforce least privilege rules.**  
2. **Traffic filtering must be implemented to prevent known malicious domains and IPs.**  
3. **DNS security must be enabled using filtering services (e.g., DNSSEC, RPZ, or DNS filtering).**  
4. **Edge security must include intrusion prevention/detection systems (IPS/IDS).**  

---

### **4.3 Network Segmentation & Least Privilege Access**  
1. **Internal networks must be segmented based on security zones (e.g., DMZ, Internal, Management).**  
2. **Critical systems should not be accessible from user networks.**  
3. **All remote access must be controlled using Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA).**  

---

### **4.4 Configuration Management & Change Control**  
1. **All network configuration changes must be documented and stored in version control (e.g., Git).**  
2. **Configuration backups must be maintained securely and encrypted.**  
3. **Routine audits must be conducted to detect unauthorized changes.**  

---

### **4.5 Network Monitoring & Logging**  
1. **All network devices must log traffic and security events to a centralized logging system.**  
2. **Anomaly detection must be enabled to alert on suspicious activity.**  
3. **Logs must be retained for at least 90 days to support forensic analysis.**  

```

## **4. Best Practices for Implementing This Policy**  

Organizations implementing **CIS Control 12 â€“ Network Infrastructure Management** should consider the following best practices:  

- **Use a Defense-in-Depth Approach** â€“ Secure the network with **multiple layers of security controls**, including **firewalls, intrusion prevention, and endpoint protection**.  
- **Regularly Update Network Firmware** â€“ **Monthly firmware updates reduce vulnerabilities** and **patch security flaws**.  
- **Implement Network Access Control (NAC)** â€“ **Prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network**.  
- **Restrict Open Ports & Services** â€“ **All unnecessary ports must be disabled to reduce the attack surface**.  
- **Centralize Logging & Alerting** â€“ **Monitor all network traffic for anomalies** using **a SIEM solution**.  

These strategies **enhance network security, enforce least privilege access, and improve incident detection and response**.

## **5. Example Implementation in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**  

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, CIS Control 12 is implemented with the following measures:  

### **5.1 Network Security & Access Controls**  

âœ… **FortiGate firewall enforces least privilege inbound/outbound rules.**  
âœ… **Network traffic is encrypted using TLS 1.3 and VPN tunnels.**  
âœ… **MFA is required for all remote access via Entra Private Access.**  

### **5.2 Firewall & Traffic Security**  

âœ… **Default-deny inbound policy prevents unauthorized access attempts.**  
âœ… **Traffic filtering blocks known malicious domains and C2 servers.**  
âœ… **Intrusion prevention (IPS) inspects and blocks attack attempts.**  

### **5.3 Network Segmentation & Access Restrictions**  

âœ… **Critical research systems are isolated from general access networks.**  
âœ… **Administrative systems require Just-In-Time (JIT) access approval.**  
âœ… **Guest access is restricted to an isolated VLAN with minimal privileges.**  

### **5.4 Configuration Management & Logging**  

âœ… **All firewall configurations are stored in Git for version control.**  
âœ… **Network logs are aggregated in Loki and monitored via Prometheus.**  
âœ… **All network changes require a documented change request process.**

## **6. Summary and Next Steps**  

âœ… **This document presents the official CISv8 Network Infrastructure Management Policy Template.**  
âœ… **It includes additional information on possible solutions for implementation.**  
âœ… **A high-level example from the Proxmox Astronomy Lab is provided for reference.**  

ðŸ“Œ **Actionable Next Steps:**  

- **Ensure network segmentation enforces least privilege access.**  
- **Regularly update firmware and apply security patches to network devices.**  
- **Centralize logging and use SIEM for real-time network monitoring.**  

ðŸš€ **By following this framework, organizations can ensure structured, secure, and auditable network infrastructure management.**
