# üîç **CIS Control 18: Penetration Testing & Red Team Exercises**

## üõ°Ô∏è **1. Introduction**

CIS Control 18 forms a critical component of our security validation strategy, establishing proactive testing and assessment procedures to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. This control ensures that security controls are regularly validated and improved to address emerging threats.

Penetration testing and security assessments are critical for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities **before they can be exploited**. **CIS Control 18** mandates structured security testing procedures to ensure **resilience against threats and proactive risk mitigation**.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** follows a **layered security model** that incorporates **Zero Trust principles, network segmentation, and internal security reviews**, aligning with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

The following table outlines our key security testing components and their implementation:

| **Key Security Testing Features** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **No Externally Exposed Services** | All inbound traffic **restricted via Entra Private Access (EPA)**. |
| **Strict Firewall Policies** | FortiGate firewall enforces **default deny** inbound access. |
| **Internal Security Validation** | Monthly **network segmentation & firewall policy reviews**. |
| **Container & Kubernetes Security** | Hardened **Docker configurations, RBAC policies, and Helm security** in RKE2. |
| **Threat Monitoring & Logging** | **Wazuh + Loki** for anomaly detection and continuous monitoring. |

This integrated approach ensures comprehensive security validation while acknowledging the lab's unique architecture with limited external exposure.

## üéØ **2. Scope**

This control applies to all security testing activities within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab environment, establishing clear requirements for validation while acknowledging the lab's unique architecture.

The following table outlines the scope boundaries for our security testing program:

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | Internal infrastructure, firewall policies, identity security, and container security. |
| **Out-of-Scope** | External penetration testing (as no public-facing assets exist). |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 18, NIST 800-53 (CA-8), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.12.6). |

This defined scope ensures that security resources are focused on the most relevant validation activities while maintaining compliance with applicable frameworks.

## üîÑ **3. Security Testing Implementation**

### **3.1 Internal Security Reviews & Threat Simulation**

Given the lab's limited external exposure, our security testing strategy focuses on internal validation of security controls and configurations.

The following table details our internal security review implementation:

| **Testing Type** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Firewall & Network Policy Review** | Monthly **FortiGate and VLAN segmentation policy analysis**. |
| **Endpoint Security Validation** | **Wazuh scans** for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. |
| **Configuration Audits** | Regular reviews of **container security, RBAC, and IAM policies**. |

These internal reviews ensure that security controls are properly implemented and maintained throughout the environment.

### **3.2 Internal Penetration Testing & Security Assessments**

While traditional external penetration testing has limited applicability, we maintain appropriate security assessment capabilities focused on internal validation.

The following table outlines our security assessment approach:

| **Assessment Type** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **External Penetration Test** | **Not required**, as no public-facing assets exist. |
| **Internal Penetration Test** | Focuses on **network segmentation and access control testing**. |
| **Cloud Security Review** | Ensures **Azure & AWS security configurations remain compliant**. |

This focused approach ensures appropriate security validation while efficiently allocating security resources.

### **3.3 Continuous Security Monitoring & Incident Detection**

Continuous monitoring complements our security testing by providing ongoing validation of security controls between formal assessments.

The following table outlines our security monitoring implementation:

| **Security Measure** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **SIEM & Threat Detection** | **Wazuh + Loki** for real-time anomaly detection. |
| **Firewall Log Analysis** | Monthly **FortiGate review for misconfigurations**. |
| **Access Logs & Identity Protection** | **Entra ID monitors all authentication attempts**. |

This continuous monitoring ensures that security issues are identified and addressed promptly, enhancing the effectiveness of our periodic security assessments.

## üìä **4. Compliance Evidence**

Maintaining evidence of control implementation is essential for demonstrating compliance and ensuring continued effectiveness. Our documentation provides comprehensive coverage of each sub-control's implementation.

The following table maps CIS Control 18 sub-controls to our implementation documentation:

| **Control** | **Implementation Details** | **Reference Document** |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **18.1** | Internal penetration testing and security validation. | [CISv8 18.1 Implementation](./18.1.md) |
| **18.2** | Continuous monitoring and threat analysis. | [CISv8 18.2 Implementation](./18.2.md) |
| **18.3** | Firewall segmentation review and network hardening. | [CISv8 18.3 Implementation](./18.3.md) |
| **18.4** | Role-based access control and IAM security testing. | [CISv8 18.4 Compliance](./18.4.md) |

This structured documentation approach ensures that all aspects of the control are properly addressed and verified through regular assessment.
