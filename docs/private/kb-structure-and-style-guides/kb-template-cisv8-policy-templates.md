# **5. Example Implementation in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**  

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, CIS Control [#] is implemented with the following measures:  

## **5.1 Policy Enforcement & Authentication**  
‚úÖ **MFA is enforced for all user logins through Entra ID Conditional Access.**  
‚úÖ **Privileged accounts require passwordless authentication using FIDO2 security keys.**  
‚úÖ **Account logins are geofenced to the United States, restricting unauthorized foreign access.**  

## **5.2 Monitoring & Incident Response**  
‚úÖ **Security logs are aggregated into Azure Sentinel for analysis and correlation.**  
‚úÖ **Automated alerts are configured for policy violations or unusual login activity.**  
‚úÖ **Account compromise detection is enabled via Microsoft Defender for Identity.**  

## **5.3 Policy Hardening & Continuous Improvement**  
‚úÖ **Regular security audits ensure all configurations align with CIS benchmarks.**  
‚úÖ **System misconfigurations trigger automated remediation playbooks via Ansible.**  
‚úÖ **Entra Identity Governance conducts periodic access reviews to prevent privilege creep.**

This ensures **consistent structure and readability** across all CIS policy templates.

- ‚úÖ **Use clear, structured headings** (`#` for major sections, `###` for subsections).  
- ‚úÖ **Keep the CIS-provided policy template untouched** inside a code block for easy reference.  
- ‚úÖ **Provide best practices without naming specific paid solutions** unless they are industry standards.  
- ‚úÖ **Clearly separate Proxmox Lab implementation** from general recommendations.  
- ‚úÖ **Always web-search to validate best practices** for accuracy and industry relevance.
