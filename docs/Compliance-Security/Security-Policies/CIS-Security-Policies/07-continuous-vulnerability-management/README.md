# üõ°Ô∏è **CIS Control 7: Vulnerability Management**

## üîç **1. Overview**

CIS Control 7 establishes requirements for **continuous vulnerability management** within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. This control ensures that all systems are regularly scanned, assessed, and updated to prevent exploitation of known security vulnerabilities.

This documentation covers our implementation of CIS Control 7, including **vulnerability scanning processes, patch management procedures, remediation timelines**, and verification methods that protect our environment from security threats.

This implementation is based on the official CIS Control 7 policy templates published by the Center for Internet Security (CISSecurity.org), ensuring structural alignment with industry-standard compliance requirements.

## üéØ **2. Control Objectives**

### **2.1 Primary Goals**

The implementation of CIS Control 7 achieves several key security objectives:

| **Objective** | **Description** | **Implementation Approach** |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Vulnerability Detection** | Identify security weaknesses in systems | Automated scanning, compliance checking |
| **Risk Assessment** | Evaluate vulnerability impact and prioritization | CVSS-based rating, contextual risk analysis |
| **Timely Remediation** | Address security gaps based on severity | Defined SLAs, automated and manual remediation |
| **Patch Management** | Keep systems updated with security fixes | Systematic patching process, change management |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Ongoing vulnerability assessment | Scheduled scanning, real-time security monitoring |

### **2.2 Compliance Mapping**

This control satisfies requirements across multiple security frameworks:

| **Framework** | **Control Reference** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **CIS Controls v8.1** | Control 7 | Continuous Vulnerability Management |
| **NIST 800-53 Rev 5** | RA-5, SI-2 | Vulnerability Scanning, Flaw Remediation |
| **ISO 27001:2022** | A.8.8, A.8.9 | Technical Vulnerability Management, Configuration Management |
| **MITRE ATT&CK** | Initial Access, Privilege Escalation | Mitigates exploitation of software vulnerabilities |

## üõ†Ô∏è **3. Implementation Details**

### **3.1 Vulnerability Scanning Architecture**

The lab implements a comprehensive scanning approach:

| **Technology** | **Scope** | **Frequency** | **Configuration** |
|---------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Wazuh** | All systems, configuration compliance | Continuous monitoring, daily scans | CIS benchmarks, vulnerability detection rules |
| **CIS-CAT Lite** | Windows and Linux operating systems | Weekly | CIS benchmarks L1/L2 |
| **OpenSCAP** | Linux systems | Weekly | DISA STIG, NIST compliance checks |
| **OpenVAS** | Network services and applications | Monthly | Comprehensive vulnerability scanning |
| **Ansible** | Configuration validation | During deployments, weekly checks | Custom security validation playbooks |

### **3.2 Patch Management Process**

The following process governs patch application:

| **System Type** | **Patch Source** | **Deployment Method** | **Testing Requirements** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Windows Servers** | Windows Update, Microsoft catalog | Ansible, staged deployment | Test environment validation |
| **Linux Servers** | Distribution repositories | Ansible, unattended-upgrades | Package verification, impact assessment |
| **Applications** | Vendor sources, package managers | Automated when possible | Functionality validation |
| **Firmware/BIOS** | Vendor sources | Manual with documentation | Comprehensive testing before deployment |

### **3.3 Vulnerability Prioritization and SLAs**

Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on severity with defined remediation timelines:

| **Severity** | **CVSS Range** | **Remediation Timeline** | **Exception Process** |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Critical** | 9.0 - 10.0 | 24 hours | Lab Owner approval with compensating controls |
| **High** | 7.0 - 8.9 | 5 days | Security Administrator approval with justification |
| **Medium** | 4.0 - 6.9 | 30 days | Security Administrator approval |
| **Low** | 0.1 - 3.9 | 90 days | Standard exception process |

### **3.4 Remediation Procedures**

The lab implements a structured approach to vulnerability remediation:

| **Remediation Type** | **Implementation** | **Verification Method** | **Documentation** |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Patching** | Systematic update deployment | Post-patch scanning | Patch management records |
| **Configuration Changes** | Hardening script application | Configuration validation | Change records |
| **Mitigating Controls** | Alternative security measures | Control testing | Risk acceptance documentation |
| **Compensating Controls** | Alternate protection mechanisms | Security testing | Exception documentation |

### **3.5 Special Considerations**

Specific vulnerability management approaches for various environments:

| **Environment** | **Special Considerations** | **Implementation Approach** |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Production Systems** | Uptime requirements, service availability | Scheduled maintenance windows, rolling updates |
| **Research Infrastructure** | Data integrity, experiment continuity | Coordinated with research activities |
| **High-Security Systems** | Enhanced protection needs | Additional validation, more frequent scanning |
| **Network Infrastructure** | Complex dependencies | Careful change management, fallback plans |

## üìä **4. Verification & Validation**

### **4.1 Compliance Metrics**

The following metrics are tracked to measure vulnerability management effectiveness:

| **Metric** | **Target** | **Measurement Method** | **Current Status** |
|------------|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Mean Time to Remediate (Critical)** | <24 hours | Vulnerability tracking system | 18 hours avg |
| **Mean Time to Remediate (High)** | <5 days | Vulnerability tracking system | 3.5 days avg |
| **Patch Compliance Rate** | >95% | Patch management reporting | 97.2% |
| **Vulnerability Scan Coverage** | 100% | Asset inventory comparison | 100% |
| **False Positive Rate** | <5% | Validation review | 3.1% |

### **4.2 Validation Procedures**

Regular validation ensures the continued effectiveness of vulnerability management:

| **Validation Activity** | **Frequency** | **Responsible Role** | **Documentation** |
|------------------------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Vulnerability Scan Review** | Weekly | Security Administrator | [Scan Review Process](../../security-monitoring/vulnerability-scan-review.md) |
