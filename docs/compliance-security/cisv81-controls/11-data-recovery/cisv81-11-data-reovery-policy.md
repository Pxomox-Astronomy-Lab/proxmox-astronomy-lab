# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-11 Data Recovery Policy**

## **1. Overview**

### **Why This Policy Matters**

Data recovery ensures that enterprise-critical information remains **protected, available, and recoverable** in the event of **cybersecurity incidents, hardware failures, or natural disasters**. This policy defines the **backup, encryption, retention, and recovery processes** for the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

### **Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **data recovery and protection** through:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Daily Backups** | All lab data is backed up daily with a 14-day retention period. |
| **Offsite Storage for Redundancy** | 4 weekly and 1 monthly backup are stored offsite in Wasabi. |
| **Encryption of Backup Data** | All backups are encrypted using enterprise keys. |
| **Quarterly Recovery Testing** | A Windows and Linux VM are restored quarterly to validate recoverability. |
| **Access Controls for Backup Data** | Backup files are protected against unauthorized access or modification. |

This policy aligns with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**, ensuring enterprise-wide backup and recovery compliance.

---

## **2. Compliance Mapping**

This policy aligns with **industry security frameworks** to maintain best practices:

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 11 â€“ Data Recovery |
| **NIST 800-53** | CP-9 â€“ Information System Backup |
| **ISO 27001** | A.12.3 â€“ Backup & Recovery Management |

---

## **3. Responsibilities**

Roles and responsibilities ensure **proper enforcement of data recovery policies**:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Implement and manage backup solutions, ensure encryption, and conduct recovery tests. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Verify successful backup completion, enforce retention policies, and assist in recovery efforts. |
| **Users** | Store enterprise data in approved locations to ensure backup coverage. |

---

## **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Backup Planning & Execution**

A formalized backup process must be **established, documented, and reviewed annually**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Backup Scope** | All critical lab data is included in daily backups. |
| **Backup Automation** | Backups are automated via enterprise backup software. |
| **Retention Policy** | Data is retained for **14 days**, with **weekly and monthly backups offsite**. |
| **Encryption & Security** | All backups are encrypted with enterprise keys. |

---

### **4.2 Secure Backup Storage**

Backup storage locations must be **protected against unauthorized access**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Onsite Backup Storage** | Stored in secure, access-controlled environments. |
| **Offsite Backup Storage** | Backups stored in **Wasabi cloud storage** with **restricted access**. |
| **Backup Isolation** | Offsite backups **are not directly accessible from the network**. |
| **Data Integrity Verification** | Regular integrity checks on stored backups. |

---

### **4.3 Data Encryption & Security**

All backup data must be **encrypted to prevent unauthorized access**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Encryption Algorithm** | AES-256 encryption applied to all backup data. |
| **Key Management** | Encryption keys managed through enterprise key infrastructure. |
| **Access Restrictions** | Only authorized personnel can decrypt backup data. |

---

### **4.4 Data Recovery Testing**

Regular recovery testing ensures **backup integrity and system readiness**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Quarterly Recovery Testing** | A Windows and Linux VM are restored every 3 months. |
| **Disaster Recovery Simulation** | IT performs simulated recoveries as part of annual audits. |
| **Recovery Documentation** | Test results and recovery times are logged for review. |

---

### **4.5 Incident Response & Data Restoration**

In the event of an incident, **data must be restored in a structured, prioritized manner**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Incident Response Activation** | IT follows the **Data Recovery Plan** in coordination with security teams. |
| **Prioritization of Recovery** | Critical systems restored first based on impact analysis. |
| **Monitoring During Recovery** | System performance and integrity checked post-recovery. |
| **User Notification** | Relevant stakeholders informed of recovery progress and completion. |
