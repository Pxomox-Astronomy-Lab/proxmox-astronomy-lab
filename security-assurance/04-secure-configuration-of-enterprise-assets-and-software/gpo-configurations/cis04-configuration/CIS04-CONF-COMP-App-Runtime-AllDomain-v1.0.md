# üîê **CIS04-CONF-COMP-App-Runtime-AllDomain-v1.0**

This document provides comprehensive configuration details for the Windows App Runtime security hardening Group Policy Object, implementing CIS Control 4 (Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software) by managing Microsoft Account integration across all domain-joined computers in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab infrastructure.

# üéØ **1. Introduction**

This section establishes the foundational context for App Runtime security configuration within the enterprise Windows hardening framework.

## **1.1 Purpose**

This subsection explains how the App Runtime GPO contributes to systematic identity management by controlling Microsoft Account requirements and reducing external authentication dependencies through configuration management.

The App Runtime GPO implements critical identity control by making Microsoft Accounts optional for application runtime operations, preventing forced cloud authentication requirements that could bypass enterprise identity management systems. This configuration ensures that domain-joined computers maintain consistent authentication boundaries while supporting application functionality without requiring external Microsoft Account dependencies that could introduce security vulnerabilities or compliance complications.

## **1.2 Scope**

This subsection defines the boundaries of App Runtime security configuration within the Windows Server 2025 security baseline implementation.

The GPO applies to all domain-joined computers across the infrastructure, targeting Windows App Runtime authentication mechanisms through Administrative Template policy enforcement. The configuration scope focuses specifically on Microsoft Account dependency management, ensuring applications can function without requiring consumer Microsoft Account authentication while maintaining compatibility with enterprise authentication systems and domain-based identity management.

# üîó **2. Dependencies & Relationships**

This section maps how the App Runtime GPO integrates with other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security components, establishing both upstream and downstream dependencies.

## **2.1 Related Services**

This subsection identifies other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security services that interact with App Runtime configuration management.

The App Runtime GPO operates within the comprehensive identity management framework, coordinating with Active Directory authentication policies, Azure AD integration systems, and application control mechanisms to ensure consistent authentication behavior across the enterprise infrastructure.
