## **üõ†Ô∏è RBAC Implementation Framework**

This section documents the role-based access control implementation and security group architecture.

## **4.1 Three-Tier Staff Model**

This subsection documents the enterprise three-tier staff model and role-based access control implementation.

Three-tier staff model provides systematic role hierarchy through HelpDesk (Tier 1), SysOps (Tier 2), and Engineering (Tier 3) classifications, supporting graduated access control, privilege escalation procedures, and systematic access management ensuring appropriate permissions for astronomical research computing operations.

Staff model implementation includes role definitions, access control matrices, privilege boundaries, escalation procedures, and systematic validation ensuring comprehensive access control across enterprise infrastructure supporting astronomical research operations and security requirements.

## **4.2 Security Group Hierarchy**

This subsection documents Azure AD security group hierarchy and organizational structure for enterprise access control.

Security group hierarchy provides systematic group organization through functional roles, service access groups, administrative privilege groups, and application-specific permissions, supporting role-based access control, permission inheritance, and systematic group management ensuring effective access control for enterprise computing resources.

Group hierarchy includes functional groups (HelpDesk, SysOps, Engineering), service groups (Infrastructure, Applications, Databases), administrative groups (Privileged Access, Security), and systematic group relationships ensuring comprehensive access control across hybrid infrastructure supporting astronomical research operations.

## **4.3 Permission Management**

This subsection documents permission assignment, access control validation, and privilege management procedures.

Permission management provides systematic approaches for access control through role-based assignments, principle of least privilege, permission validation, and systematic access governance ensuring appropriate access control for enterprise computing resources supporting astronomical research operations.

Management procedures include permission matrices, access control validation, privilege assignment workflows, access review procedures, and systematic compliance validation ensuring effective permission management across infrastructure supporting astronomical research operations and compliance requirements.

# üîí **5. Security & Compliance**

This section documents security controls and compliance alignment for security groups and RBAC implementation.

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY DISCLAIMER**

*The security implementations described in this document are part of ongoing baseline establishment and should not be considered production-ready specifications. Our team consists of research computing professionals, not dedicated security experts. All security measures are implemented as best-effort implementations based on industry standards. For production deployments requiring formal security validation, engage qualified security professionals for comprehensive review and approval.*

## **5.1 Security Controls**

This subsection documents specific security measures for security groups and role-based access control.

**Enterprise-grade access control security guided by industry standards.** Security controls for security groups and RBAC include principle of least privilege, segregation of duties, privileged access management, access monitoring, and systematic security validation ensuring secure access control for enterprise computing resources.

Access control security encompasses group-based permissions, role validation, privilege monitoring, access certification, and appropriate security configuration ensuring access control security while supporting enterprise permission requirements and astronomical research operations.

## **5.2 CIS Controls Mapping**

This subsection provides explicit mapping to CIS Controls v8, documenting compliance status and implementation evidence for access control.

**Baseline Standards:** CIS Controls v8, NIST AI Risk Management Framework  
**Framework:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0  
**Mapping to:** NIST SP 800-171

| **CIS Control** | **Implementation Status** | **Evidence Location** | **Assessment Date** |
|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **CIS.6.1** | **Compliant** | Azure AD security groups and role-based access control implementation | **Informal Gap Assessment** |
| **CIS.6.2** | **Compliant** | Three-tier staff model with graduated access control and privilege management | **Informal Gap Assessment** |
| **CIS.6.4** | **Partial** | Privileged access management with Azure AD PIM and access validation | **Informal Gap Assessment** |

| **CIS.6.6** | **Compliant** | Application-specific access controls through security group integration | **Informal Gap Assessment** |

**Reference**: [CIS Ubuntu 24.04 Implementation](../../../docs/compliance-security/README.md)

## **5.3 Framework Compliance**

This subsection demonstrates how security groups and RBAC satisfy requirements across multiple compliance frameworks.

Security groups and RBAC implementation aligns with CIS Controls v8 baseline, NIST AI Risk Management Framework requirements, NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 requirements, and NIST SP 800-171 requirements through systematic implementation of comprehensive access control, role-based permissions, and compliance validation procedures appropriate for enterprise computing infrastructure supporting astronomical research with AI/ML workloads.

# üíæ **6. Backup & Recovery**

This section documents comprehensive data protection strategies and recovery processes across the 7-node Proxmox Astronomy Lab infrastructure.

## **6.1 Protection Strategy**

This subsection details backup approaches, schedules, and retention policies implemented across hybrid Kubernetes and VM infrastructure.

**Comprehensive Multi-Tier Backup Strategy:** Data protection encompasses systematic backup across all infrastructure layers with automated scheduling, retention management, and offsite replication ensuring comprehensive protection for virtual machines, databases, and configuration data supporting astronomical research operations and compliance requirements.

**Backup Implementation by Platform:**

| **Platform Type** | **Backup Solution** | **Schedule** | **Retention** | **Offsite Strategy** |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Linux VMs** | **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)** | **Weekly: 4 backups, Monthly: 1 backup** | **30 days** | **Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** |
| **Windows VMs** | **Veeam Backup & Replication Community** | **Weekly: 4 backups, Monthly: 1 backup** | **30 days** | **Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** |
| **Database Systems** | **Iperius Backup** | **Weekly: 4 backups, Monthly: 1 backup** | **30 days** | **Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** |
| **Configuration Data** | **Git + Infrastructure Backup** | **Continuous + Weekly** | **30 days local, 12 months offsite** | **Repository replication + S3** |

All backup data encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption with keys managed through centralized key management system.

## **6.2 Recovery Procedures**

This subsection provides recovery processes for different failure scenarios across the hybrid infrastructure.

**Tiered Recovery Strategy:** Recovery procedures are organized by scope and urgency, from individual service restoration to full infrastructure rebuild. All recovery operations are documented with step-by-step procedures and tested quarterly during scheduled maintenance windows.

**Recovery Scenarios:**

- **Individual VM Recovery:** Proxmox VE restore from PBS snapshots or Veeam backup with automated integrity verification
- **Database Point-in-Time Recovery:** Iperius backup restoration with transaction consistency validation  
- **Kubernetes Service Recovery:** PV snapshot restoration with pod recreation and service validation
- **Complete Site Recovery:** Infrastructure-as-Code deployment with automated service restoration and data synchronization
- **Configuration Rollback:** Git-based configuration management with automated rollback and validation testing

**Recovery Validation:** All recovery operations include automated validation testing to ensure data integrity, service functionality, and performance baseline compliance before declaring recovery complete.
