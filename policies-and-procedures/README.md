# 📋 **Policies and Procedures**

Enterprise governance framework providing comprehensive policies, procedures, and operational standards for the Proxmox Astronomy Lab hybrid infrastructure and research computing environment. This directory establishes the foundational governance structure ensuring consistent operations, regulatory compliance, and enterprise-grade management across our 7-node astronomical computing platform.

## **Overview**

Policies and procedures provide the critical governance foundation enabling systematic, compliant, and efficient operation of our enterprise astronomical computing infrastructure. Our comprehensive policy framework ensures consistent operational standards while supporting the collaborative and innovative requirements of cutting-edge astronomical research computing.

The governance architecture integrates enterprise best practices with research computing requirements, providing scalable policy frameworks that support both current operational needs and future platform evolution. This approach ensures regulatory compliance while maintaining the operational flexibility required for dynamic astronomical research workloads and collaborative scientific computing.
