# 🔌 **MCP Servers**

This category provides comprehensive documentation for Model Context Protocol (MCP) server infrastructure supporting enterprise AI and agentic systems across the Proxmox Astronomy Lab's research computing platform. The documentation covers systematic deployment, security hardening, and operational management of MCP servers enabling AI agents to interact with infrastructure components, databases, and research services. These implementations provide the foundational protocol layer supporting advanced agentic AI workflows documented in the AI and Machine Learning section.

## **Overview**

MCP Servers represent the critical infrastructure layer enabling AI agents to interact systematically with research computing resources, database systems, container orchestration platforms, and observability infrastructure. The Proxmox Astronomy Lab implements enterprise-grade MCP server deployments centered on official vendor-supported implementations, security-hardened community servers, and systematic protocol management supporting the Glass Crucible agentic framework and collaborative intelligence systems.

The MCP infrastructure operates as the secure communication backbone between AI agents and enterprise systems, providing systematic tool execution, resource access, and prompt templates across the hybrid Kubernetes and VM architecture. These systems enable AI-driven infrastructure management, automated research workflows, database analysis capabilities, and systematic observability integration supporting scientific computing operations and collaborative research activities.
