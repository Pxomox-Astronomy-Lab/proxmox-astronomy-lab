# üõ°Ô∏è **CIS Control 10: Malware Defense**

## üîç **1. Introduction**

CIS Control 10 forms a critical component of our defense-in-depth strategy, providing comprehensive protection against malware threats through multiple integrated security measures. This control ensures that all systems are continuously monitored, updated, and protected from evolving threat vectors.

Malware defense is **critical to protecting enterprise assets** from **viruses, ransomware, unauthorized software, and advanced threats**. **CIS Control 10** mandates the use of **anti-malware tools, continuous security monitoring, and automated remediation** to prevent, detect, and mitigate malware risks.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** employs a **multi-layered malware defense strategy** to ensure compliance with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

The following table outlines our key malware defense components and their implementation:

| **Key Malware Defense Features** | **Implementation** |
|---------------------------------|------------------|
| **Endpoint Protection** | Windows: Defender + Wazuh; Linux: Chkrootkit, RKHunter, Wazuh Agent. |
| **Automated Updates** | Daily security definition updates and OS patching via Ansible/Win-Get. |
| **Anti-Exploitation Features** | ASLR, DEP, and Secure Boot enabled on all supported systems. |
| **Centralized Logging** | Wazuh SIEM collects and analyzes malware alerts. |
| **Unauthorized Software Detection** | Systems flagged for policy violations and manual review. |

This integrated approach ensures that malware threats are identified and remediated quickly while maintaining operational continuity.

## üéØ **2. Scope**

This control applies to all assets within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab environment with specific implementation requirements based on system type and function. Clear definition of scope ensures appropriate coverage while acknowledging practical limitations.

The following table outlines the scope boundaries for our malware defense implementation:

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | All Windows & Linux-based enterprise assets. |
| **Out-of-Scope** | Air-gapped test environments without internet connectivity. |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 10, NIST 800-53 (SI-3), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.12.2). |

This defined scope ensures that security resources are focused on protecting systems with the highest risk exposure while maintaining compliance with applicable frameworks.

## üîí **3. Malware Defense Implementation**

### **3.1 Endpoint Protection & Automated Updates**

Our endpoint protection strategy focuses on continuous monitoring and automated updates to prevent malware infections before they can impact our environment. This proactive approach minimizes the window of vulnerability to known threats.

The following table details our endpoint protection implementation:

| **Security Measure** | **Enforcement** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Anti-Malware Software** | Windows: Defender + Wazuh; Linux: Chkrootkit, RKHunter, Wazuh Agent. |
| **Automatic Updates** | Daily security updates for anti-malware software and OS patches. |
| **Application Control** | Unauthorized software flagged for review and removal. |

This combination of tools and processes ensures comprehensive protection while minimizing administrative overhead through automation.

### **3.2 Exploit Protection & Hardening**

Beyond traditional anti-malware tools, we implement system-level hardening and exploit mitigation to create additional security layers. These protections help prevent exploitation even when malware attempts to target system vulnerabilities.

The following table outlines our exploit protection approach by system type:

| **System** | **Exploit Protection** |
|------------|------------------|
| **Windows** | ASLR, DEP, Windows Defender Exploit Guard enabled. |
| **Linux** | ASLR, NX-bit, SELinux/AppArmor, Secure Boot. |
| **All Systems** | Security configurations enforced via Ansible and Group Policy. |

These defense mechanisms significantly increase the difficulty of successful exploitation, complementing our anti-malware tools.

### **3.3 Logging, Detection & Incident Response**

Effective threat detection requires comprehensive visibility and a structured response process. Our approach ensures that security events are properly captured, analyzed, and addressed.

The following table outlines our detection and response implementation:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Threat Logging & Monitoring** | Wazuh SIEM aggregates and analyzes malware detections. |
| **Security Alerts** | High-severity alerts are escalated immediately. |
| **Incident Response** | Manual review and quarantine of infected systems. |

This centralized approach ensures consistent handling of security events while maintaining an audit trail for compliance and forensic purposes.

## üìä **4. Compliance Evidence**

Maintaining evidence of control implementation is essential for demonstrating compliance and ensuring continued effectiveness. Our documentation provides comprehensive coverage of each sub-control's implementation.

The following table maps CIS Control 10 sub-controls to our implementation documentation:

| **Control** | **Implementation Details** | **Reference Document** |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **10.1** | Anti-malware software deployment across all enterprise assets. | [CISv8 10.1 Implementation](./10.1.md) |
| **10.2** | Automated updates for security definitions and OS patches. | [CISv8 10.2 Implementation](./10.2.md) |
| **10.3** | Unauthorized software detection and remediation. | [CISv8 10.3 Implementation](./10.3.md) |
| **10.4** | Centralized malware logging and alerting. | [CISv8 10.4 Compliance](./10.4.md) |

This structured documentation approach ensures that all aspects of the control are properly addressed and verified through regular assessment.
