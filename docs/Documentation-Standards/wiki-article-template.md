# [Task Title]

Brief description of what this accomplishes and what you'll learn to do.

## Why We Do This

In the Proxmox Astronomy Lab, we [implement this approach/use this pattern/follow this procedure]. While [alternative approaches exist/this can be done other ways], we implement this approach because:

- **[Benefit 1]**: [Explanation of why this matters in our environment]
- **[Benefit 2]**: [How this fits our architecture/workflow]
- **[Benefit 3]**: [Operational or strategic advantage]
- **[Benefit 4]**: [Additional context specific to our lab]

This [pattern/approach/procedure] is used consistently across [relevant lab infrastructure/systems/workflows].

## Prerequisites

- [System requirements]
- [Access requirements]
- [Required knowledge level]
- [Any preparatory steps needed]

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: [Action Title]

```bash
command here
```

[Explanation of what this command does and why it's necessary.]

### Step 2: [Next Action Title]

```bash
another command
```

[Clear explanation of the purpose and any important details.]

### Step 3: [Continue Pattern]

```bash
final command
```

[Explanation including any options or variations.]

## Verification

[How to confirm the procedure worked correctly:]

```bash
# Command to verify success
verification command
```

[What the expected output should look like and what it means.]

## Troubleshooting

**[Common Issue 1]:** [Brief description of problem and solution]

```bash
# Fix command if applicable
solution command
```

**[Common Issue 2]:** [Description and resolution]

**[Common Issue 3]:** [Another typical problem and how to resolve it]

## **ðŸ“‹ Wiki Template Usage Guidelines**

### **Article Types and Length Targets**

- **How-To Guides**: 200-400 lines, focus on step-by-step procedures
- **Configuration Guides**: 300-500 lines, include configuration examples and troubleshooting
- **Quick References**: 100-200 lines, concise command references and checklists
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: 200-300 lines, problem-solution focused

### **Content Principles**

- **Practical Focus**: Every article should solve a real problem or accomplish a specific task
- **Lab Context**: Include "Why We Do This" to explain our architectural decisions
- **Tested Procedures**: Only include steps that have been verified to work
- **Clear Commands**: Use actual command examples, not pseudocode
- **Standalone Articles**: Each article should work independently

### **Section Guidelines**

#### **"Why We Do This" Section**

- Start with lab context: "In the Proxmox Astronomy Lab, we..."
- Acknowledge alternatives: "While [other approaches exist]..."
- Explain our reasoning: "...we implement this approach because:"
- Keep to 4 bullet points maximum
- End with consistency note about lab-wide usage

#### **Prerequisites Section**

- List actual system requirements
- Specify required access levels
- Note any preparatory steps
- Keep realistic - don't over-specify

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

- Use descriptive step titles
- Include actual commands in code blocks
- Explain what each command does and why
- Keep explanations concise but informative

#### **Verification Section**

- Provide specific commands to test success
- Explain what successful output looks like
- Include multiple verification methods when helpful

#### **Troubleshooting Section**

- Focus on real issues you've encountered
- Provide specific solutions, not generic advice
- Include fix commands when applicable
- Bold the problem description for quick scanning

### **Technical Standards**

- **Commands**: Use actual tested commands, not examples
- **Paths**: Use realistic paths that match lab infrastructure
- **Output**: Include example output when it helps understanding
- **Formatting**: Consistent code block and table formatting
- **Links**: Use relative links for internal wiki articles

### **Quality Indicators**

- âœ… Article accomplishes stated objective
- âœ… All commands have been tested and work
- âœ… Lab context explains our specific approach
- âœ… Troubleshooting covers real issues
- âœ… Article can be followed independently
- âœ… Appropriate length for article type
- âœ… Clear, actionable step titles
- âœ… Proper tagging for discoverability
