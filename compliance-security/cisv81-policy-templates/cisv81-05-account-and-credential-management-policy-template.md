# **üîê CISv8 Account and Credential Management Policy Template**

## **1. Overview**  

### **Why This Policy Matters**  

The **Account and Credential Management Policy** ensures that **user, system, and service accounts are securely managed**, reducing the risk of **unauthorized access, account compromise, and privilege escalation**. Weak or poorly managed credentials are a primary attack vector for security breaches, making **strong identity governance essential**.

Key aspects of this policy include:  

‚úÖ **Enforcing strong authentication mechanisms, including MFA**.  
‚úÖ **Defining a secure process for account creation, modification, and termination**.  
‚úÖ **Implementing least privilege and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.  
‚úÖ **Monitoring and logging access events for compliance and auditing**.  

This document **presents the CISv8 Account and Credential Management Policy Template** and includes **additional information on how organizations may implement it**, along with a **generalized example of its application in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

# Account and Credential Management Policy Template  

## **Purpose**  
Account and credential management is the process of **creating, provisioning, using, and terminating accounts and credentials** in the enterprise. This policy provides **the processes and procedures for governing accounts and credentials securely**.

---

## **Responsibility**  
- **IT is responsible** for managing account creation, modification, and termination.  
- **Users are responsible** for following security best practices and protecting their credentials.  
- **System administrators must ensure compliance with authentication and access control policies**.  

---

## **Policy**  

### **5.1 Account Onboarding & Provisioning**  
1. **IT must maintain procedures for modifying access, permissions, and roles** for user accounts.  
   - **Newly created accounts must be included in the account management process**.  
   - **Permissions must follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP)**.  
2. **All privileged accounts must be unique and assigned to an individual user**.  
3. **Shared administrator accounts must be eliminated whenever possible**.  

---

### **5.2 Account Creation & Management**  
1. **IT must develop procedures for creating accounts and assigning privileges**.  
2. **Administrative privileges must only be provided to administrative accounts**.  
3. **It is the responsibility of IT to maintain an inventory of all accounts**.  
4. **At a minimum, the inventory must contain**:  
   - **User‚Äôs full name**  
   - **Account name**  
   - **Employment start and stop dates**  
   - **Business unit**  
   - **Account status (enabled, disabled)**  
5. **All enabled accounts must be reviewed quarterly for accuracy**.  

---

### **5.3 Credential Creation & Security**  
1. **All passwords must be unique and adhere to the following requirements**:  
   - **Passwords for MFA-enabled accounts: Minimum 8 characters**.  
   - **Passwords for non-MFA accounts: Minimum 14 characters**.  
2. **Users must not reuse passwords between personal and enterprise accounts**.  
3. **Default passwords must be changed immediately upon first login**.  

---

### **5.4 Account & Credential Usage**  
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for**:  
   - **All externally accessible applications**.  
   - **All third-party SaaS applications that support MFA**.  
   - **All privileged administrative accounts**.  
2. **All remote users must use MFA to access internal enterprise systems**.  
3. **MFA is enforced for all administrative accounts across on-prem and cloud**.  

---

### **5.5 Access Modification & Termination**  
1. **User accounts that have not been accessed within 45 days must be disabled**.  
2. **Accounts for employees on extended leave must be disabled**.  
3. **Upon termination, all user credentials must be revoked immediately**.  
4. **Self-service password reset cannot be used to reactivate disabled accounts**.  

---

### **5.6 Monitoring & Logging**  
1. **All account activity must be logged and monitored for security purposes**.  
2. **Failed login attempts, privilege escalations, and account modifications must generate security alerts**.  
3. **Audit logs must be retained and reviewed for compliance**.  

```

## **4. Best Practices for Implementing This Policy**  

Organizations implementing **CIS Control 5 ‚Äì Account and Credential Management** should consider:  

- **Centralizing identity management using an Identity & Access Management (IAM) solution** ‚Äì This ensures **consistent enforcement of access policies across the enterprise**.  
- **Enforcing password policies via Active Directory Group Policy (GPO) or cloud IAM platforms**.  
- **Using automated tools to detect and disable inactive accounts** ‚Äì Regular account audits prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Applying Just-In-Time (JIT) access controls for privileged accounts** ‚Äì Reduces the attack surface by granting **temporary elevation** instead of permanent administrative access.  
- **Logging and monitoring account-related events** ‚Äì SIEM solutions can **detect anomalies in login patterns and privilege escalation attempts**.  

These best practices **help organizations align with industry standards and maintain a secure authentication environment**.

## **5. Example Implementation in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**  

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, **CIS Control 5** is implemented through the following methods:

### **5.1 Identity & Access Management (IAM)**  

‚úÖ **User accounts are managed using Entra ID and Active Directory**.  
‚úÖ **All privileged accounts require MFA using FIDO2 security keys**.  
‚úÖ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is enforced across systems**.  

### **5.2 Privileged Account Security**  

‚úÖ **Just-In-Time (JIT) privileged access is enforced for administrator accounts**.  
‚úÖ **Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is used to grant temporary access**.  
‚úÖ **High-risk sign-ins are automatically blocked via conditional access policies**.  

### **5.3 Logging & Compliance Monitoring**  

‚úÖ **Loki monitors account activity and detects anomalies in the central logs**.  
‚úÖ **Failed login attempts, account lockouts, and privilege escalations generate security alerts**.  
‚úÖ **Quarterly access reviews ensure users retain only the necessary permissions**.

## **6. Summary and Next Steps**  

‚úÖ **This document presents the official CISv8 Account and Credential Management Policy Template.**  
‚úÖ **It includes additional information on possible implementation strategies.**  
‚úÖ **A high-level example from the Proxmox Astronomy Lab is provided for reference.**  

üìå **Actionable Next Steps:**  

- **Ensure all privileged accounts are secured with MFA and Just-In-Time elevation**.  
- **Conduct regular account audits to detect stale or unauthorized accounts**.  
- **Use identity analytics tools to detect anomalies in account activity**.  

üöÄ **By following this framework, organizations can significantly reduce credential-based security risks and improve overall identity governance.**
