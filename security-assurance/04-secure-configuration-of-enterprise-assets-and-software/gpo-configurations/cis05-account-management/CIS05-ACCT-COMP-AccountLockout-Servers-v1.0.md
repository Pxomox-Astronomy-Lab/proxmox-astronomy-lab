# üîí **CIS05-ACCT-COMP-AccountLockout-Servers-v1.0**

This Group Policy Object implements Administrator account lockout protection specifically for Member Servers within the Windows Server 2025 Active Directory environment. The GPO enables systematic brute force attack defense against privileged accounts while maintaining operational accessibility for legitimate administrative access through targeted server-specific lockout policy configuration and coordinated privileged account protection mechanisms.

The policy configuration implements CIS Control 5 (Account and Credential Management) requirements by establishing specialized lockout protection for built-in Administrator accounts on Member Servers, addressing the unique security risks associated with privileged account targeting while ensuring continued administrative capability for legitimate server management operations across the enterprise domain infrastructure.

| **Server Infrastructure** | Provides Member Server-specific administrative account protection | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High |
| **Operational Balance** | Maintains administrative accessibility while enhancing security | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High |

## **3.3 Implementation Standards**

This subsection establishes technical standards for Administrator account lockout policy deployment and enterprise privileged account security management.

Administrator account lockout policy implementation follows systematic deployment standards and operational procedures:

- **Deployment Method**: Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) with Member Server organizational unit targeting
- **Target Scope**: Member Servers with built-in Administrator account usage
- **Testing Protocol**: Controlled implementation through test servers with administrative access validation
- **Monitoring Integration**: Privileged account security event logging with administrative activity correlation
- **Documentation Standard**: Complete configuration mapping with CIS control references and operational impact assessment

# üîó **4. Implementation & Usage**

This section provides systematic guidance for implementing Administrator account lockout policy configuration and establishing privileged account protection across Member Server infrastructure.

## **4.1 Prerequisites**

This subsection identifies requirements for successful Administrator account lockout policy implementation within Member Server infrastructure.

Administrator account lockout policy implementation requires enterprise server infrastructure with appropriate administrative access and comprehensive privileged account management capabilities:

- **Member Server Infrastructure**: Windows Server 2025 Member Servers with Group Policy application capability
- **Administrative Access**: Domain Admin or equivalent Group Policy management permissions for privileged account policy configuration
- **Privileged Account Management**: Established administrative account procedures and emergency access protocols
- **Testing Environment**: Isolated Member Servers for controlled policy testing and administrative access validation
- **Operational Procedures**: Administrative account unlock workflows and privileged access incident response coordination

## **4.2 Monitoring**

This subsection establishes monitoring requirements for Administrator account lockout policy effectiveness and privileged account security validation across Member Server infrastructure.

Administrator account lockout monitoring leverages the centralized monitoring stack on proj-mon01 (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, AlertManager, Grafana Alloy) for systematic privileged account protection tracking and administrative security event analysis. The monitoring philosophy of "if it can be collected, we do" applies to Administrator account lockout events, privileged access patterns, and administrative security incident detection through centralized security monitoring infrastructure.

Monitoring includes privileged account lockout correlation, administrative access pattern analysis, and server-specific security event tracking through comprehensive privileged account security monitoring and automated alerting for administrative credential attacks.

# üîê **6. Security & Compliance**

This section establishes security framework alignment and compliance requirements for Administrator account lockout policy configuration within enterprise privileged account security architecture.

## **6.1 Security Framework Alignment**

This subsection maps Administrator account lockout policy configuration to enterprise security frameworks and compliance requirements for systematic privileged account protection.

**Security Disclaimer**: The Administrator account lockout policy configuration documented in this guide represents a privileged account security baseline establishment for Windows Server 2025 Member Server infrastructure. These configurations should be thoroughly tested in non-production environments before deployment. While these templates follow CIS Controls v8 privileged account security framework guidelines, organizations should validate policy compatibility with their specific administrative access requirements and business operational needs. The security research computing team maintains these configurations as implementation guidance rather than production security recommendations, and encourages consultation with dedicated security professionals for enterprise deployment validation.

### **Framework Mapping**

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** | **Implementation Evidence** |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **CIS Controls v8** | Control 5: Account and Credential Management | Administrator account lockout policy implementing privileged account protection |

Administrator account lockout policy configuration enables systematic compliance evidence collection through Group Policy Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) reporting and privileged account security validation. Compliance validation requires regular policy application assessment and administrative account protection monitoring to maintain baseline privileged credential security posture across Member Server infrastructure components.

# üìã **7. Backup & Recovery**

This section establishes protection and recovery procedures for Administrator account lockout policy configuration and privileged account security baseline preservation.

## **7.1 Protection Strategy**

This subsection defines systematic protection requirements for Administrator account lockout policy configuration and privileged account security baseline preservation.

Administrator account lockout policy configuration requires multi-tier protection strategy encompassing Group Policy backup, version control, and policy baseline preservation to ensure rapid privileged account security recovery and systematic policy restoration capabilities.

### **Protection Tiers**
