# 🔄 **Reproducibility and Infrastructure as Code Framework**

This directory documents the planned framework for systematic reproducibility and Infrastructure as Code implementation across the Proxmox Astronomy Lab platform. **IMPORTANT: This represents the documented vision and architectural planning rather than current implementation.** When this repository goes live, reproducibility will be limited to manual clone-and-DIY approaches while we work toward automated Infrastructure as Code deployment through Ansible, Helm charts, ArgoCD, and comprehensive scientific workflow automation.

# 🎯 **1. Introduction**

This section establishes the foundational context for reproducibility infrastructure planning within the enterprise astronomical research computing platform and the roadmap toward systematic Infrastructure as Code implementation supporting scientific research reproducibility.

## **1.1 Purpose**

This subsection clearly articulates the planned reproducibility infrastructure objectives while transparently acknowledging current limitations and future implementation milestones for systematic automation and scientific workflow reproducibility.

The reproducibility infrastructure framework documents the planned systematic approach to Infrastructure as Code implementation, scientific workflow automation, and comprehensive configuration management that will enable systematic platform reproduction and research workflow replication. **Current State Disclaimer: This documentation represents architectural planning and future implementation roadmap rather than operational capabilities.** Currently, platform reproduction requires manual setup processes, manual configuration replication, and individual implementation of research workflows. The planned framework will provide Ansible-automated infrastructure deployment, GitOps-managed configuration workflows, comprehensive SQL query repositories for projects like the cosmic void analysis, and systematic scientific computing environment reproduction capabilities supporting enterprise research reproducibility objectives.

## **1.2 Scope**

This subsection defines the precise boundaries of reproducibility framework planning and explicitly states what automation capabilities are documented as future objectives versus current implementation status.

| **Planned Scope (Future Implementation)** | **Current Limitations (Manual Processes)** |
