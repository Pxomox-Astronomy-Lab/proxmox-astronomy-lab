# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-08 Audit Log Management Policy**

## **1. Overview**

### **Why This Policy Matters**

Audit log management is essential for identifying and responding to **suspicious or anomalous activity** across enterprise assets. This policy ensures that **all logs are properly generated, stored, transmitted, and analyzed** to support **security operations, forensic investigations, and compliance requirements**.

### **Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **audit log management** through:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Comprehensive Log Collection** | Prometheus, Loki, Alert Manager, and Grafana stack for centralized logging. |
| **90-Day Log Retention** | Logs stored for 90 days with alerts enabled for key security events. |
| **Time Synchronization** | All systems synced to `us.pool.ntp.org` using Chrony (Linux) or Windows Time Service. |
| **Advanced Audit Logging** | Auditd deployed with a comprehensive ruleset on Linux, logs stored on separate partitions. |
| **DNS & Traffic Logging** | Logs from Windows DCs and Technitium DNS centrally collected and monitored. |
| **System-Level Event Collection** | All supported systems collect security-relevant events for analysis. |

This policy aligns with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**, ensuring a structured, automated, and auditable approach to log management.

---

## **2. Compliance Mapping**

This policy aligns with **industry security frameworks** to maintain best practices:

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 8 â€“ Audit Log Management |
| **NIST 800-53** | AU-2 â€“ Event Logging |
| **ISO 27001** | A.12.4 â€“ Logging & Monitoring |

---

## **3. Responsibilities**

Roles and responsibilities ensure **proper enforcement of audit log policies**:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Configure and maintain centralized logging, enforce retention policies, and monitor logs. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Ensure audit logging is enabled across all enterprise assets and review alerts. |
| **Users** | Follow logging policies, report anomalies, and ensure required system updates are applied. |

---

## **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Audit Log Generation & Collection**

All enterprise assets must generate and retain **audit logs for security and compliance monitoring**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **System Metrics & Logs** | Prometheus, Loki, Alert Manager, and Grafana collect logs from all systems. |
| **Audit Logging (Linux)** | Auditd enabled with a comprehensive ruleset from [Neo23x0/auditd](https://github.com/Neo23x0/auditd). |
| **DNS & AD Logging** | Logs from Windows DCs and Technitium DNS shipped to centralized logging. |
| **Retention Period** | Logs are stored for a minimum of 90 days. |
| **Event Alerting** | Basic alerts are configured for log anomalies. |

---

### **4.2 Time Synchronization & Consistency**

Time synchronization ensures **log integrity across all assets**:

| **System** | **Time Synchronization Method** |
|------------|---------------------------|
| **Windows Servers** | Windows Time Service (NTP via `us.pool.ntp.org`). |
| **Linux Servers** | Chrony (NTP via `us.pool.ntp.org`). |
| **Enforcement** | Ansible ensures automatic time drift correction. |

---

### **4.3 Log Transmission & Storage**

Audit logs must be **secured and centrally stored**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Centralized Storage** | Logs stored in a protected partition separate from system partitions. |
| **Access Controls** | Strict access permissions prevent unauthorized modification. |
| **Log Forwarding** | Logs from Windows DCs, DNS, and application services shipped to Loki. |

---

### **4.4 Log Review & Analysis**

Automated and manual log reviews ensure **timely identification of security events**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Automated Anomaly Detection** | Wazuh SIEM and Prometheus Alert Manager monitor logs. |
| **High-Severity Event Handling** | Immediate escalation per incident response guidelines. |
| **Periodic Log Reviews** | Administrators review security logs at least weekly. |

---

### **4.5 Audit Log Retention & Disposal**

Logs must be retained **for security investigations and compliance requirements**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Retention Period** | Logs stored for a minimum of 90 days. |
| **Archived Logs** | Older logs archived for forensic analysis. |
| **Secure Disposal** | Logs securely deleted per data retention policy. |
