# 🔒 **5. Security & Compliance**

This section establishes security framework alignment and compliance requirements for secure configuration management within enterprise security architecture.

## **5.1 Security Framework Alignment**

This subsection maps secure configuration management policy to enterprise security frameworks and compliance requirements for systematic security baseline establishment.

**Security Disclaimer**: The secure configuration management policy documented in this framework represents a comprehensive security baseline establishment for enterprise infrastructure. These requirements should be thoroughly validated in test environments before production implementation. While these policies follow CIS Controls v8 security framework guidelines, organizations should validate configuration management compatibility with their specific operational requirements and business needs. The security research computing team maintains these policies as implementation guidance rather than production security recommendations, and encourages consultation with dedicated security professionals for enterprise deployment validation.
