# üìã **1. Implementation Overview**

This Group Policy Object implements Windows Defender Firewall security configuration for all domain-joined computers within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab enterprise environment. The GPO enables firewall state and logging for all network profiles (Domain, Private, Public) to provide comprehensive network traffic filtering, enhance security monitoring capabilities, and maintain consistent firewall protection across diverse network environments and connection scenarios.

The configuration addresses fundamental network security requirements by ensuring Windows Defender Firewall is enabled across all network profiles, implementing comprehensive logging for security analysis, and providing systematic network traffic control essential for network infrastructure protection, threat detection, and security incident response across the domain infrastructure.

## **3.2 Structure and Organization**

The Windows Defender Firewall GPO implements comprehensive firewall security controls through Group Policy Advanced Firewall configuration targeting all network profiles:

### **Firewall Profile Configuration**

| **Network Profile** | **Firewall State** | **Logging Configuration** | **Security Impact** |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Domain Profile** | Enabled | Connections and dropped packets logged | Protects domain-connected systems with enterprise security policies |
| **Private Profile** | Enabled | Connections and dropped packets logged | Secures private network connections with appropriate filtering |
| **Public Profile** | Enabled | Connections and dropped packets logged | Provides maximum protection on untrusted public networks |

### **Firewall Security Controls**

| **Security Control** | **Configuration Path** | **Setting** | **Security Objective** |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Domain Firewall State** | Windows Firewall with Advanced Security ‚Üí Domain Profile | State: On | Enable firewall protection for domain network connections |
| **Private Firewall State** | Windows Firewall with Advanced Security ‚Üí Private Profile | State: On | Enable firewall protection for private network connections |
| **Public Firewall State** | Windows Firewall with Advanced Security ‚Üí Public Profile | State: On | Enable firewall protection for public network connections |
| **Domain Logging** | Windows Firewall with Advanced Security ‚Üí Domain Profile ‚Üí Logging | Log successful connections: Yes, Log dropped packets: Yes | Comprehensive domain network traffic logging |
| **Private Logging** | Windows Firewall with Advanced Security ‚Üí Private Profile ‚Üí Logging | Log successful connections: Yes, Log dropped packets: Yes | Complete private network traffic logging |
| **Public Logging** | Windows Firewall with Advanced Security ‚Üí Public Profile ‚Üí Logging | Log successful connections: Yes, Log dropped packets: Yes | Full public network traffic logging |

### **Implementation Verification**

| **Verification Method** | **Expected Result** | **Validation Command** |
|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Firewall State Check** | All profiles enabled | `Get-NetFirewallProfile | Select Name, Enabled` |
| **Logging Configuration** | Logging enabled for all profiles | `Get-NetFirewallProfile | Select Name, LogAllowed, LogBlocked` |
| **Policy Application** | Group Policy settings applied | `gpresult /h firewall_policy_report.html` |
| **Log File Verification** | Firewall logs being generated | Check `%SystemRoot%\System32\LogFiles\Firewall\pfirewall.log` |

## **3.3 Integration and Procedures**

Windows Defender Firewall security implementation follows systematic deployment through Group Policy targeting all domain-joined computers with comprehensive firewall protection validation.

### **Deployment Procedure**

1. **Pre-Deployment Assessment**
   - Verify domain infrastructure readiness and firewall service dependencies
   - Confirm network application requirements and firewall rule compatibility
   - Validate logging infrastructure capacity and log management procedures

2. **GPO Implementation**
   - Deploy GPO targeting All Domain Computers through Group Policy Management Console
   - Configure firewall settings through Windows Firewall with Advanced Security
   - Validate policy precedence and firewall configuration inheritance

3. **Post-Deployment Validation**
   - Force policy update on all domain systems
   - Verify firewall state through administrative validation
   - Test network connectivity and application functionality
   - Confirm logging operation and log file generation

# üõ†Ô∏è **4. Management & Operations**

## **4.1 Lifecycle Management**

Windows Defender Firewall security lifecycle management encompasses firewall assessment, systematic deployment, operational monitoring, and continuous security validation based on network threat landscape evolution.

## **4.2 Monitoring & Quality Assurance**

**Monitoring Infrastructure:** All monitoring is handled by proj-mon01, the centralized monitoring stack consisting of Prometheus (metrics), Loki (logs), Grafana (visualization), AlertManager (alerting), and Grafana Alloy (metrics/logging agent). Monitoring philosophy follows "if it can be collected, we do" approach with comprehensive Windows Defender Firewall log collection, traffic analysis, and security event correlation.

## **4.3 Maintenance and Optimization**

Windows Defender Firewall security maintenance encompasses regular firewall state validation, log analysis procedures, rule optimization assessment, and systematic security control verification for sustained network perimeter protection.

# üîí **5. Security & Compliance**

## **5.1 Security Framework Alignment**

**Security Disclaimer**: The Windows Defender Firewall security configuration documented in this GPO represents a network perimeter security baseline for Windows domain-joined systems. These configurations should be thoroughly tested in non-production environments before deployment. While these templates follow CIS Controls v8 network infrastructure management framework guidelines, organizations should validate Windows Defender Firewall security compatibility with their specific application requirements and network connectivity needs. The security research computing team maintains these configurations as implementation guidance rather than production security recommendations, and encourages consultation with dedicated security professionals for enterprise deployment validation.
