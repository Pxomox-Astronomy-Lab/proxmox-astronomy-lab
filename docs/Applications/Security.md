# üõ°Ô∏è **Security Applications**

The Security Applications section documents the tools, platforms, and services that protect the Proxmox Astronomy Lab infrastructure and data. These applications provide comprehensive security monitoring, threat detection, password management, and compliance verification capabilities.

## üîç **1. Overview**

This overview provides context for the lab's approach to security applications, covering the purpose and scope of our protection mechanisms.

### **1.1 Purpose**

This section documents the **security monitoring systems, password management tools, and compliance verification applications** deployed within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. It serves as a reference for the **architecture, configuration, and operational aspects** of these critical services that protect infrastructure, applications, and research data from threats and vulnerabilities.

### **1.2 Scope**

The following table defines what is included and excluded from this documentation to help readers understand its boundaries.

| **In Scope** | **Out of Scope** |

- **SIEM/XDR** - Centralized security event monitoring and correlation
- **Secrets Management** - Secure password storage and sharing with Vaultwarden
- **Vulnerability Management** - Automated scanning and reporting
- **Compliance Monitoring** - Continuous verification of security baselines
- **Active Response** - Automated and manual incident response capabilities

### **3.2 Infrastructure Components**

The following table details the key infrastructure components that make up our security solution:

| **Component** | **Description** | **CMDB ID** |
|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Security Monitoring Server | Wazuh SIEM/XDR platform | lab-soc01 |
| Password Management | Vaultwarden password vault | lab-apps01 |
| Security Database | PostgreSQL for security events | lab-db01 |
| Scanning Engine | OpenSCAP/OpenVAS for vulnerability scanning | lab-soc01 |
| Agents/Collectors | Wazuh agents on all systems | multiple |
| Alert Management | Alertmanager and MS Teams integration | lab-mon01 |

### **3.3 Dependencies**

The following table outlines the dependencies and relationships between security applications and other infrastructure components:

| **Dependency Type** | **Service/Component** | **Impact if Unavailable** |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Requires** | PostgreSQL Database | Security event storage unavailable |
| **Requires** | Reverse Proxy | Web interfaces inaccessible |
| **Requires** | Entra ID / Zitadel | Authentication limitations |
| **Requires** | Network Infrastructure | Agent communication disrupted |
| **Required By** | Compliance Reporting | Security posture visibility reduced |
| **Required By** | Incident Response | Threat detection capabilities degraded |

## üîê **4. Service Management**

This section describes how security applications are managed, including access control and security monitoring of the security systems themselves.

### **4.1 Access Management**

The following table outlines the access management approach for security applications:

| **User Role** | **Access Level** | **Authorization Process** |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Security Administrator | Full administration | Approved by Lab Owner via Zitadel |
| Engineer | View access with limited configuration rights | Approved by Security Administrator |
| Operator | View-only access to dashboards and events | Approved by Engineer |
| Application Owner | Access to application-specific views | Approved by Security Administrator |
| User | Access to own Vaultwarden account only | Self-registration with MFA enforcement |

### **4.2 Security Monitoring & Alerting**

The following table details how the security systems themselves are monitored:

| **Security Aspect** | **Monitoring Method** | **Alert Severity** |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Wazuh Availability | Prometheus endpoint, heartbeat | Critical |
| Vaultwarden Availability | HTTP check, process monitor | Critical |
| Database Integrity | Regular checksums, backup verification | Critical |
| Agent Connectivity | Wazuh built-in monitoring | Warning |
| Ruleset Updates | Verification of policy application | Warning |
| Encryption Verification | TLS certificate monitoring | Warning |
