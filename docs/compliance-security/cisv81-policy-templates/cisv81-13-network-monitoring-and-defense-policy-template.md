# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-13 Network Monitoring and Defense Policy Template**

## **1. Purpose**  

Effective network monitoring and defense are essential for **detecting threats, preventing unauthorized access, and enforcing network segmentation**. While CIS provides **Control 13: Network Monitoring and Defense**, no official template has been provided.  

This document presents a **custom network monitoring and defense policy template** in alignment with **CISv8 best practices, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.  

---

## **2. Scope**  

This policy applies to **all network devices, monitoring tools, and access control policies** governing VLANs, network segmentation, and security event logging.

### **Key Objectives**  

This policy enforces **network monitoring and defense** through:  

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Traffic Monitoring & Logging** | Wazuh and Loki used for network monitoring, depending on use case. |
| **VLAN Traffic Control** | VLAN-to-VLAN policies enforced for segmentation. |
| **Restricted Remote Access** | No remote access permitted to the internal lab network. |
| **Physical Network Security** | Network policies implemented on labswitch01 and labswitch02. |
| **Continuous Review** | Policies and configurations reviewed on a **monthly basis**. |

---

## **3. Compliance Mapping**  

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 13 â€“ Network Monitoring and Defense |
| **NIST 800-53** | SC-5 â€“ Denial-of-Service Protection, SC-7 â€“ Boundary Protection |
| **ISO 27001** | A.13.1 â€“ Network Security Controls |

---

## **4. Responsibilities**  

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Maintain network monitoring tools, enforce VLAN security policies, and manage segmentation controls. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Ensure logs are collected, monitor alerts for anomalies, and review security configurations. |
| **Users** | Follow access control policies and report any suspicious network behavior. |

---

## **5. Policy Implementation**  

### **5.1 Network Traffic Monitoring & Logging**  

All network activity must be **monitored, logged, and analyzed** to detect threats and unauthorized access attempts.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Traffic Analysis** | Wazuh and Loki deployed to monitor and log network events. |
| **Alerting & Detection** | Suspicious activity generates alerts for review. |
| **Log Retention** | Logs retained for **90 days** for forensic investigation. |

---

### **5.2 VLAN Segmentation & Access Control**  

Strict VLAN policies ensure **network segmentation and isolation of critical assets**.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **VLAN Segmentation** | VLAN-to-VLAN communication restricted based on security policies. |
| **Firewall Policy Enforcement** | Traffic filtering applied to enforce segmentation. |
| **Logging & Alerts** | All policy violations logged and reviewed. |

---

### **5.3 Remote Access Security**  

No remote access is permitted to **internal lab assets**, reinforcing network security.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Remote Access Restriction** | No external access to the lab network. |
| **Administrative Access** | Local access only via secure, segmented VLANs. |

---

### **5.4 Physical Network Security & Hardware Enforcement**  

Physical network security policies apply to **hardware network switches and security appliances**.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Physical Switch Security** | Network access policies enforced on labswitch01 and labswitch02. |
| **Unauthorized Device Detection** | Alerts generated for unapproved network devices. |

---

### **5.5 Policy Review & Continuous Improvement**  

Network security configurations must be **regularly reviewed and updated**.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Security Policy Review** | Network policies reviewed on a **monthly basis**. |
| **Log Analysis & Incident Response** | Logs analyzed for security trends and potential misconfigurations. |
| **Compliance Monitoring** | Regular audits ensure compliance with CIS benchmarks. |

---

## **6. Exception Handling**  

Exceptions to this policy must be **requested in writing** and include:  

- **Justification for the request**  
- **Risk assessment of non-compliance**  
- **Proposed alternative mitigations**  
- **Technical challenges preventing compliance**  
- **Planned review date for reevaluation**  

---

## **7. Enforcement & Non-Compliance**  

Failure to comply with this policy may result in:  

- Restricted access to lab network resources  
- Escalation to security teams for further investigation  
- Remedial actions required to restore compliance
