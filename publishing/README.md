# ðŸ“‘ **Publishing**

Scientific publication workflows and data release procedures for astronomical research projects in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab.

## **Overview**

This directory contains procedures for publishing research results from our astronomical computing projects, particularly the DESI cosmic void analysis. The focus is on creating FAIR-compliant data products and supporting peer-reviewed publications.

## **Current Focus: DESI Cosmic Void Publication**

Based on the DESI cosmic void analysis project, we're developing workflows for:

- **Data Validation**: Quality assurance procedures for scientific datasets before publication
- **FITS VAC Creation**: Value-Added Catalog preparation using FITS format standards
- **Publication Workflow**: End-to-end process from analysis results to journal submission

## **Key Components**

### **Data Validation**

Quality assurance procedures ensuring scientific datasets meet publication standards:

- FITS file structure validation
- Statistical consistency checks
- Cross-matching validation between catalogs
- FAIR principles compliance verification

### **Publication Standards**

Following established astronomical publication practices:

- FITS header metadata standards
- VizieR ReadMe file preparation
- CDS submission procedures
- Journal-specific requirements (MNRAS, ApJ, A&A)

### **Archival and DOI Management**

Permanent preservation of research objects:

- Zenodo code archival with GitHub integration
- DOI minting for citable research products
- Cross-referencing between papers, data, and code
