# **ðŸ“œ README - CIS Control 16: Application Security & Software Integrity**

## **1. Introduction**

Ensuring **secure software development and deployment** is critical for **maintaining the integrity, security, and reliability of applications**. **CIS Control 16** mandates a structured approach to **application security, software integrity, and compliance** to reduce risks and prevent vulnerabilities.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** employs **secure coding practices, container security, dependency management, and continuous security monitoring** in compliance with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

| **Key Software Security Features** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Secure Software Development** | Adheres to CIS-compliant secure coding standards. |
| **Public Repository Management** | **GitHub** hosts public releases with issue tracking and pull request acceptance. |
| **Container & Dependency Security** | Managed through **Snipe-IT and Azure Container Registry (ACR)**. |
| **Trusted Libraries & Dependencies** | Only vetted libraries are used (e.g., **NASA Astronomy Libraries, Astropy**). |
| **Secure Deployment Pipelines** | Hardened **Docker configurations, Helm charts, RKE2 Kubernetes deployments**. |
| **Development Isolation** | Dev workloads are deployed in **a dedicated namespace on the K8s cluster**. |
| **Code Scanning & Security Audits** | **GitHub code scanning** enabled for **proxmox-astronomy-lab repo**. |

## **3. Secure Software Implementation**

### **Secure Software Development & Deployment**

All software must be **securely developed, tested, and deployed**.

| **Security Measure** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Public Releases** | GitHub-hosted with issue tracking and PR acceptance. |
| **Version Control & Audits** | All changes managed via **Git** for tracking and auditing. |
| **Secure CI/CD Pipelines** | GitHub Actions for automated builds and security scanning. |

### **Container & Dependency Security**

Software components must be **tracked and securely managed**.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Software Inventory Management** | **Snipe-IT** tracks all applications and dependencies. |
| **Container Registry & SBOMs** | **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** manages containers securely. |
| **Dependency Security** | Trusted libraries (e.g., **Astropy, NASA Astronomy Libraries**) are used. |

### **Infrastructure & Deployment Protection**

All applications must be **deployed securely** and follow best practices.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Secure Containers & Infrastructure** | Hardened **Docker, Helm charts, and RKE2 Kubernetes deployments**. |
| **Data Security Standards** | **Database TLS connections, encryption at rest**. |
| **Development Environment Isolation** | **Dedicated K8s dev namespace** for testing before deployment. |

### **Code Security Scanning & Continuous Monitoring**

All public repositories must have **automated security scanning enabled**.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **GitHub Code Scanning** | Enabled for **proxmox-astronomy-lab repo** to detect security issues. |
| **CI/CD Security Checks** | GitHub Actions scan for vulnerabilities before merging. |
| **Continuous Security Reviews** | Security policies reviewed annually based on emerging threats. |
