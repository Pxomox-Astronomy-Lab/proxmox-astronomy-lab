# pg_hba.conf for proj-pg01 - Primary DESI Analysis Database
# ==============================================================================
#
# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration
#
# SERVER ROLE: Primary astronomical database for DESI cosmic void analysis
# SECURITY PROFILE: Restricted network access with secure authentication
#
# AUTHENTICATION STRATEGY:
# - Local connections use peer authentication for administrative access
# - Network connections require scram-sha-256 (encrypted password authentication)
# - Access restricted to trusted infrastructure subnets only
# - No public internet access permitted
#
# TRUSTED NETWORKS:
# - 10.25.20.0/24: Project network (Kubernetes pods, analysis nodes)
# - 10.25.10.0/24: Management network (monitoring, backup systems)

# Last Updated: July 21, 2025

# --- LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE ACCESS ---
# Unix domain socket access for local administration
local   all         postgres                                peer

# --- TRUSTED NETWORK ACCESS ---
# Application and service connections from infrastructure subnets

# Monitoring system access for performance metrics collection
host    all         postgres_exporter   10.25.20.0/24       scram-sha-256
host    all         postgres_exporter   10.25.10.0/24       scram-sha-256

# DESI development environment access (proj-dp01 and analysis nodes)
host    all         desi_dev            10.25.20.0/24       scram-sha-256
host    all         desi_dev            10.25.10.0/24       scram-sha-256

# --- LOCAL SYSTEM ACCESS ---
# Standard local access patterns for system administration
local   all         all                                     peer
host    all         all                 127.0.0.1/32        scram-sha-256
host    all         all                 ::1/128             scram-sha-256

# --- REPLICATION ACCESS ---
# PostgreSQL streaming replication (future use)
local   replication all                                     peer
host    replication all                 127.0.0.1/32        scram-sha-256
host    replication all                 ::1/128             scram-sha-256

# --- NOTES ---
# 1. All network authentication uses scram-sha-256 for security
# 2. Access is restricted to infrastructure subnets only
# 3. No wildcard network access is permitted
# 4. Additional users should follow the same subnet restriction pattern
# 5. Connection logging is enabled in postgresql.conf for audit purposes
