# **ðŸ“œ README - CIS Control 11: Data Recovery**

## **1. Introduction**

Data recovery is **critical for maintaining business continuity** in the event of **cybersecurity incidents, hardware failures, or natural disasters**. **CIS Control 11** mandates a structured approach to **data backup, encryption, retention, and recovery testing** to ensure that essential data remains **secure and recoverable**.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** employs a **multi-tiered backup strategy** to ensure compliance with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

| **Key Data Recovery Features** | **Implementation** |
|-------------------------------|------------------|
| **Automated Daily Backups** | All critical data is backed up daily with a **14-day retention period**. |
| **Offsite Backup Redundancy** | Weekly and monthly backups stored securely in **Wasabi cloud storage**. |
| **Backup Encryption** | AES-256 encryption applied to all stored backups. |
| **Quarterly Recovery Testing** | Windows & Linux VMs restored every **3 months** to verify recoverability. |
| **Strict Access Controls** | Backup files are **access-restricted and monitored** for integrity. |

## **2. Scope**

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | All backups of critical lab data, including servers, applications, and user files. |
| **Out-of-Scope** | Temporary files, non-critical test environments. |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 11, NIST 800-53 (CP-9), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.12.3). |

## **3. Data Recovery Implementation**

### **Backup & Storage Strategy**

Backups must be **automated, redundant, and securely stored**.

| **Security Measure** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Backup Frequency** | Daily backups with a **14-day retention period**. |
| **Offsite Storage** | Weekly & monthly backups stored securely in Wasabi. |
| **Backup Encryption** | AES-256 encryption applied to all backup data. |
| **Access Controls** | Only authorized personnel can access or restore data. |

### **Recovery Testing & Incident Response**

Recovery tests validate backup integrity and ensure disaster readiness.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Quarterly Recovery Tests** | Windows & Linux VMs restored every 3 months. |
| **Disaster Recovery Drills** | Simulated recovery scenarios tested annually. |
| **Incident-Based Recovery** | Prioritized recovery based on impact analysis. |

### **Backup Security & Monitoring**

To prevent unauthorized access or corruption, **backup security is enforced**.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Data Integrity Checks** | Automated integrity verification during backup creation. |
| **Backup Isolation** | Offsite backups **not directly accessible from production systems**. |
| **Retention & Disposal** | Secure deletion policies apply to expired backups. |

## **4. Compliance Evidence**

| **Control** | **Implementation Details** | **Reference Document** |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **11.1** | Secure, encrypted backups created daily. | [CISv8 11.1 Implementation](./11.1.md) |
| **11.2** | Offsite backup redundancy with secure access controls. | [CISv8 11.2 Implementation](./11.2.md) |
| **11.3** | Regular recovery testing to ensure backup integrity. | [CISv8 11.3 Implementation](./11.3.md) |
| **11.4** | Role-based access control for all backup files. | [CISv8 11.4 Compliance](./11.4.md) |

ðŸ“Œ **Each sub-control has a dedicated document outlining its enforcement and validation.**
