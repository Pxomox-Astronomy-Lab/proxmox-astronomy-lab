# 🔐 **Access Management Policies and Procedures**

Enterprise access control policies, user management procedures, and authentication frameworks governing secure access to the Proxmox Astronomy Lab hybrid infrastructure and research computing resources. This directory establishes comprehensive access governance ensuring appropriate security controls while enabling efficient astronomical research collaboration across our 7-node enterprise platform.

## **Overview**

Access management policies and procedures provide the foundational security governance framework ensuring appropriate access controls, user lifecycle management, and authentication standards across our hybrid infrastructure. Our comprehensive access management approach balances robust security requirements with the collaborative needs of astronomical research computing while maintaining compliance with enterprise security frameworks.

The access management architecture integrates role-based access control (RBAC) with planned enterprise authentication systems, providing scalable and maintainable access governance that supports both current operational needs and future platform growth. This approach ensures consistent security policies across VM-based services, Kubernetes environments, and specialized research computing resources.
