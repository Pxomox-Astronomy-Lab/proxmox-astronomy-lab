# **ðŸ“œ README - CIS Control 15: Service Provider Management**

## **1. Introduction**

Service providers, including **cloud platforms, software vendors, and third-party service providers**, must be **properly managed and monitored** to ensure **security, compliance, and service continuity**. **CIS Control 15** mandates a **structured approach** to **vendor classification, onboarding, security reviews, and decommissioning** to protect enterprise data.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** maintains an **inventory of service providers**, performs **annual security reviews**, and ensures **proper access controls** for all third-party services in compliance with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

| **Key Service Provider Management Features** | **Implementation** |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Service Provider Inventory** | All vendors tracked in **Snipe-IT** with security classifications. |
| **Onboarding & Offboarding Policies** | Documented processes for vendor approval and decommissioning. |
| **Primary Cloud Providers** | **Azure is the primary cloud provider** with limited AWS use. |
| **Annual Security & Compliance Review** | Vendors reviewed for compliance with enterprise security policies. |
| **Access Control & Monitoring** | Vendor access tracked via **Azure, Loki, and other security tools**. |
