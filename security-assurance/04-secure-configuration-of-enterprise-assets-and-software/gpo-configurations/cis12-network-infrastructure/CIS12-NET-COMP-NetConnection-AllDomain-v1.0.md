# üîí **CIS12-NET-COMP-NetConnection-AllDomain-v1.0**

## **Network Connection Security Controls**

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** July 28, 2025  
**GPO Type:** Computer Configuration  
**Target Systems:** All Domain-Joined Computers  
**CIS Control Alignment:** CIS v8 Control 12 (Network Infrastructure Management)

# üìã **1. Implementation Overview**

This Group Policy Object implements network connection security controls for all domain-joined computers within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab enterprise environment. The GPO prohibits network bridge installation, disables shared access UI presentation, and configures domain user location settings to enhance network infrastructure security, prevent unauthorized network bridging, and maintain proper network segmentation controls.

The configuration addresses critical network security requirements by preventing users from creating network bridges that could bypass security controls, eliminating shared access configuration interfaces that could expose network resources, and ensuring proper domain user network location identification for security policy application.

# üîó **2. Dependencies & Relationships**

This section maps how the Network Connection GPO integrates with Proxmox Astronomy Lab network security infrastructure and connection management components.

## **3.2 Structure and Organization**

The Network Connection GPO implements three critical network security controls through registry modifications targeting Windows network connection management:

### **Network Connection Security Controls**

| **Security Control** | **Registry Path** | **Value Name** | **Configuration** | **Security Impact** |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Network Bridge Disable** | `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Network Connections` | `NC_AllowNetBridge_NLA` | `0` (DWord) | Prohibits installation and configuration of network bridges to maintain network segmentation |
| **Shared Access UI Disable** | `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Network Connections` | `NC_ShowSharedAccessUI` | `0` (DWord) | Prevents display of shared access UI to reduce unauthorized resource sharing |
| **Domain User Location Setting** | `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Network Connections` | `NC_StdDomainUserSetLocation` | `1` (DWord) | Allows standard domain users to set network location for proper policy application |

### **Configuration Behavior**

| **Control** | **Enabled (0/1)** | **Behavior** | **Security Posture** |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Network Bridge** | `0` (Disabled) | Cannot create network bridges | **Secure** - Maintains segmentation |
| **Shared Access UI** | `0` (Hidden) | No shared access configuration interface | **Secure** - Prevents resource exposure |
| **Domain User Location** | `1` (Enabled) | Users can set network location | **Balanced** - Enables proper policy application |

### **Implementation Verification**

| **Verification Method** | **Expected Result** | **Validation Command** |
|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Registry Validation** | All three values correctly configured | `Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Network Connections" -Name "NC_AllowNetBridge_NLA", "NC_ShowSharedAccessUI", "NC_StdDomainUserSetLocation"` |
| **Network Interface Check** | No bridge interfaces available | `Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object {$_.InterfaceDescription -like "*bridge*"}` |
| **UI Validation** | Shared access options hidden in network properties | Manual verification through Network Connections interface |

## **3.3 Integration and Procedures**

Network connection security implementation follows systematic deployment through Group Policy targeting all domain-joined computers with comprehensive connection control validation.

### **Deployment Procedure**

1. **Pre-Deployment Assessment**
   - Verify domain infrastructure readiness and network connection dependencies
   - Confirm network segmentation requirements and bridge prevention needs
   - Validate user access patterns and network location requirements

2. **GPO Implementation**
   - Deploy GPO targeting All Domain Computers through Group Policy Management Console
   - Configure universal application across all domain-joined systems
   - Validate policy precedence and network connection configuration inheritance

3. **Post-Deployment Validation**
   - Force policy update on all domain systems
   - Verify registry modifications through administrative validation
   - Test network connection functionality and segmentation preservation

# üõ†Ô∏è **4. Management & Operations**

## **4.1 Lifecycle Management**

Network connection security lifecycle management encompasses security planning, systematic deployment, operational monitoring, and continuous security validation based on network attack landscape evolution.

## **4.2 Monitoring & Quality Assurance**

**Monitoring Infrastructure:** All monitoring is handled by proj-mon01, the centralized monitoring stack consisting of Prometheus (metrics), Loki (logs), Grafana (visualization), AlertManager (alerting), and Grafana Alloy (metrics/logging agent). Monitoring philosophy follows "if it can be collected, we do" approach with comprehensive network connection monitoring and bridge attempt detection.

## **4.3 Maintenance and Optimization**

Network connection security maintenance encompasses regular connection configuration validation, bridge prevention assessment, network segmentation monitoring, and systematic security control verification for sustained network infrastructure protection.

# üîí **5. Security & Compliance**

## **5.1 Security Framework Alignment**

**Security Disclaimer**: The network connection security configuration documented in this GPO represents a network infrastructure protection baseline for Windows domain-joined systems. These configurations should be thoroughly tested in non-production environments before deployment. While these templates follow CIS Controls v8 network infrastructure management framework guidelines, organizations should validate network connection security compatibility with their specific network access requirements and user functionality needs. The security research computing team maintains these configurations as implementation guidance rather than production security recommendations, and encourages consultation with dedicated security professionals for enterprise deployment validation.

| **CIS Control** | **Network Connection Implementation** | **Security Objective** |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **18.6.11.2** | Network bridge prohibition and shared access UI disable | Prevent unauthorized network bridging and maintain network segmentation integrity |

## **5.2 Compliance Requirements**

Network connection security compliance validation requires systematic policy application assessment and network segmentation monitoring through Group Policy RSoP reporting and network infrastructure analysis to maintain secure connection control posture.

# üìã **6. Backup & Recovery**

## **6.1 Protection Strategy**

Network connection security configuration requires multi-tier protection strategy encompassing Group Policy backup, network configuration export, and connection security baseline preservation.

### **Protection Tiers**

| **Tier** | **Scope** | **Method** | **Frequency** |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Tier 1** | GPO Backup | Group Policy Management Console backup | Daily automatic |
| **Tier 2** | Network Configuration Export** | PowerShell network connection configuration export | Weekly |
| **Tier 3** | Version Control** | Git repository with configuration tracking | Every change |
| **Tier 4** | Security Baseline** | Complete network connection security configuration archive | Monthly |

*Note: Iperius backup software is configured for systematic Windows infrastructure backup including Group Policy objects.*

## **6.2 Recovery Procedures**

Recovery procedures enable rapid network connection security baseline restoration through Group Policy import capabilities and network configuration restoration with priority focus on bridge prevention and segmentation control re-establishment.
