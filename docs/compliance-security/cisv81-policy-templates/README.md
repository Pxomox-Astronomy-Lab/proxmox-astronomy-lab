# **ðŸ“œ CISv8.1 Policy Templates â€“ Proxmox Astronomy Lab Compliance Framework**

The `cisv81-policy-templates` directory contains **editable security policy templates** aligned with **CIS Critical Security Controls (v8.1)**. These templates serve as **a baseline for organizations** looking to implement **customized security policies** while maintaining **compliance with industry standards** such as **CIS benchmarks, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

---

## **ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure**

The CISv8.1 compliance framework consists of **two key directories**:

1. **CISv8.1 Controls (`cisv81-controls/`)** â€“ This folder contains fully developed **security policies** that outline **mandatory compliance requirements**.  
   - ðŸ“Œ See: [CISv8.1 Controls Overview](../cisv81-controls/README.md)

2. **CISv8.1 Policy Templates (`cisv81-policy-templates/`)** â€“ This folder provides **editable templates** that can be **tailored to specific environments** while maintaining alignment with CIS benchmarks.

---

## **ðŸ“– Overview of CISv8.1 Policy Templates**

The templates in this directory follow a **structured format** that ensures consistency, clarity, and usability. Each policy template includes:

âœ… **A structured policy document** based on CISv8.1 recommendations  
âœ… **Compliance mappings** to CIS, NIST, and ISO 27001  
âœ… **Best practices** for implementing security policies  
âœ… **Customizable sections** to adapt to specific infrastructure needs  

Each policy **mirrors its corresponding policy document** in the [`cisv81-controls/`](../cisv81-controls/) directory, allowing for **easy cross-referencing between the finalized policies and customizable templates**.

## **ðŸ”§ How to Use These Templates**

ðŸ”¹ **For internal policy creation**: Customize these templates to align with your security program.  
ðŸ”¹ **For compliance validation**: Cross-check with policies in [`cisv81-controls/`](../cisv81-controls/) to ensure completeness.  
ðŸ”¹ **For automation & enforcement**: Implement monitoring tools such as **Wazuh SIEM, Grafana Alloy, and Azure Sentinel** to detect policy violations.

ðŸ“Œ **These templates are designed to be flexible yet structured, making it easier to implement security policies efficiently.**

## **ðŸ“– Next Steps**

âœ… **Customize templates for your environment**  
âœ… **Validate policies against compliance benchmarks**  
âœ… **Cross-reference finalized policies with security operations**
