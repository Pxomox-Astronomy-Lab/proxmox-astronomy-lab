Alert configuration encompasses node-level monitoring for compute nodes (node01/03/04/06/07), specialized storage node monitoring (node02/05), GPU node performance tracking (node07), and systematic infrastructure health validation ensuring comprehensive performance monitoring while supporting astronomical research operations across enterprise infrastructure with reliable alert delivery and cost-effective monitoring strategies.

```bash
# Basic performance alerting overview
# Essential infrastructure monitoring alerts
echo "=== Basic Performance Alerting ==="

# CPU utilization alerts (>85% for 5 minutes)
echo "CPU Alert: Sustained high CPU usage across cluster nodes"
echo "Threshold: >85% utilization for 5+ minutes"
echo "Target: All nodes (node01-07)"

# Memory usage alerts (>90% utilization)
echo "RAM Alert: High memory usage detection"
echo "Threshold: >90% memory utilization"
