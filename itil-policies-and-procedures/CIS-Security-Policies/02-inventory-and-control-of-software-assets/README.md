# 📦 **CIS Control 2: Inventory and Control of Software Assets**

## 🔍 **1. Overview**

CIS Control 2 establishes requirements for the **accurate inventory and effective control of all software assets** within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. This control ensures that **only authorized and supported software is installed and executed** on lab systems, reducing security risks associated with unauthorized, outdated, or vulnerable applications.

This documentation covers our implementation of CIS Control 2, including **software inventory processes, authorization mechanisms, automated detection, and execution controls** that protect our environment.

This implementation is based on the official CIS Control 2 policy templates published by the Center for Internet Security (CISSecurity.org), ensuring structural alignment with industry-standard compliance requirements.

## 🎯 **2. Control Objectives**

### **2.1 Primary Goals**

The implementation of CIS Control 2 achieves several key security objectives:

| **Objective** | **Description** | **Implementation Approach** |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Complete Software Visibility** | Maintain accurate inventory of all installed software | Centralized tracking via GLPI and Osquery |
| **Software Support Validation** | Ensure all software is currently supported by vendors | Regular support status reviews via automated checks |
| **Unauthorized Software Prevention** | Prevent installation and execution of unauthorized software | Application control policies and execution restrictions |
| **Software Lifecycle Management** | Track software from installation through decommissioning | Formal approval, installation, and removal procedures |

### **2.2 Compliance Mapping**

This control satisfies requirements across multiple security frameworks:

| **Framework** | **Control Reference** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **CIS Controls v8.1** | Control 2 | Inventory and Control of Software Assets |
| **NIST 800-53 Rev 5** | CM-7, CM-8, SI-7 | Least Functionality, System Component Inventory, Software Integrity |
| **ISO 27001:2022** | A.8.1, A.12.5.1 | Asset Management, Installation of Software on Operational Systems |
| **MITRE ATT&CK** | Defense Against Execution (TA0005) | Mitigates unauthorized code execution attack vectors |

## 🛠️ **3. Implementation Details**

### **3.1 Software Inventory Systems**

The lab employs multiple integrated systems to maintain comprehensive software inventory:

| **System** | **Purpose** | **Scope** | **Integration Points** |
|------------|------------|----------|------------------------|
| **GLPI** | Primary software asset management | All installed applications and services | AD integration, API automation |
| **Osquery** | Real-time software monitoring | Software installations, executions, changes | Wazuh integration |
| **Ansible Playbooks** | Automated compliance enforcement | Software scanning, removal, validation | GLPI API integration |
| **Zammad** | Software review workflow management | Support status validation, compliance tracking | GLPI integration |

This multi-layered approach ensures complete visibility into software assets across all systems.

### **3.2 Software Authorization & Management**

#### **3.2.1 Software Authorization Process**

All software used within the lab must go through a formal authorization process:

1. **Request Submission** - New software requirements are documented
2. **Security Review** - Security implications are assessed
3. **Support Status Verification** - Vendor support status is confirmed
4. **Formal Approval** - Software is approved or denied
5. **Approved Software List** - Approved software is added to centralized inventory

This process ensures that only properly vetted and supported software enters the environment.

#### **3.2.2 Software Support Status Management**

The lab implements a systematic approach to ensure software remains supported:

| **Review Process** | **Frequency** | **Implementation** |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Support Status Review** | Quarterly | Zammad automated ticketing |
| **End-of-Life (EOL) Tracking** | Quarterly | GLPI alerts for approaching EOL |
| **Vulnerability Monitoring** | Continuous | Wazuh monitoring for published vulnerabilities |
| **Dependency Reviews** | Quarterly | Assessment of software dependencies |

When software approaches end-of-support, a formal review determines whether to upgrade, replace, or accept risk with compensating controls.

### **3.3 Unauthorized Software Controls**

#### **3.3.1 Detection Methods**

The lab employs multiple approaches to detect unauthorized software:

| **Detection Mechanism** | **Implementation** | **Response Action** |
|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Automated Software Scans** | Osquery continuous monitoring | Alert generation, ticket creation |
| **File Integrity Monitoring** | Wazuh FIM module | Alert on unauthorized software changes |
| **Application Installation Logging** | Windows/Linux event logs | Unauthorized installation alerts |
| **Inventory Reconciliation** | Quarterly software audits | Manual review of discrepancies |

#### **3.3.2 Execution Control Mechanisms**

To prevent unauthorized software execution, several technologies are deployed:

| **Platform** | **Control Technology** | **Implementation Approach** |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Windows Systems** | AppLocker/Group Policy | Allow-list of authorized applications |
| **Linux Systems** | AppArmor Profiles | Process and resource access restrictions |
| **Container Environments** | Pod Security Policies | Image validation, privilege limitations |
| **Virtual Machines** | Secure Boot, VM Security | Integrity validation, execution controls |

| **Metric** | **Target** | **Measurement Method** | **Current Status** |
|------------|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Software Inventory Accuracy** | >98% | Quarterly reconciliation audits | 99.1% |
| **Unauthorized Software Detection** | <24 hours | Time between installation and alert | 4 hours avg |
| **Unsupported Software Instances** | 0 instances | Quarterly support status reviews | 0 instances |
| **Software Compliance Rate** | 100% | Percentage of systems with only authorized software | 100% |

### **4.2 Validation Procedures**

Regular validation ensures the continued effectiveness of software controls:

| **Validation Activity** | **Frequency** | **Responsible Role** | **Documentation** |
|------------------------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Software Inventory Audit** | Quarterly | Systems Administrator | [Audit Procedure](../../security-monitoring/software-audit-procedures.md) |
