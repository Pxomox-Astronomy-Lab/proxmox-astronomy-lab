# 📋 **1. Executive Summary**

This document provides comprehensive implementation guidance for the CIS08-AUDIT-COMP-EventLogging-AllDomain-v1.0 Group Policy Object (GPO), which configures Windows Event Log Service sizing and retention settings for Application, Setup, and System logs across all domain-joined computers in the radioastronomy.io enterprise environment. This GPO implements CIS Microsoft Windows Server 2025 Benchmark recommendations 18.10.26.1.1, 18.10.26.1.2, 18.10.26.3.1, 18.10.26.3.2, 18.10.26.4.1, and 18.10.26.4.2, establishing enterprise-grade log storage capacity and overflow management policies that ensure adequate event log retention for security monitoring and compliance requirements.

The policy addresses critical audit log management requirements by configuring appropriate log file sizing (minimum 32MB for Application, Setup, and System logs) and establishing overflow behavior that prioritizes continuous logging over log preservation. This implementation supports the enterprise's CIS Controls v8 baseline and enhances overall security monitoring capabilities through systematic event log management that provides sufficient storage capacity for comprehensive system activity tracking and security event retention across domain infrastructure.
