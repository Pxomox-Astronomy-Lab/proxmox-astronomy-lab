# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-09 Secure Configuration Management Policy**

## **1. Overview**

### **Why This Policy Matters**

Secure configurations ensure that enterprise assets are deployed and maintained **without default accounts, unnecessary services, or insecure settings** that could introduce vulnerabilities. This policy defines the **configuration, implementation, monitoring, and modification** of assets used within the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

### **Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **secure configuration management** through:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Configuration Enforcement** | Systems configured using Intune (Windows), AppArmor (Linux), and Ansible automation. |
| **Centralized DNS Management** | Technitium DNS slave zones sync from DCs, implementing DNS blocklists for security. |
| **Domain Security Protections** | DKIM, DMARC, and DNSSEC enabled and monitored across all domains. |
| **Email Security Hardening** | All email handled by Azure/Exchange Online with phishing and malware filtering. |
| **Configuration Monitoring** | Secure configurations monitored for drift and enforced via automation. |

This policy aligns with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**, ensuring a structured, automated, and auditable approach to system hardening.

---

## **2. Compliance Mapping**

This policy aligns with **industry security frameworks** to maintain best practices:

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 9 â€“ Secure Configuration Management |
| **NIST 800-53** | CM-6 â€“ Configuration Management |
| **ISO 27001** | A.14.2 â€“ Security in Development & Maintenance |

---

## **3. Responsibilities**

Roles and responsibilities ensure **proper enforcement of configuration management**:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Define secure configurations, enforce policies, and monitor compliance. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Ensure systems follow approved security baselines, implement patching, and enforce DNS security. |
| **Users** | Follow system hardening policies and report any unauthorized configuration changes. |

---

## **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Configuration Planning & Selection**

Secure configurations must be defined and implemented **before asset deployment**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **System Hardening** | Industry standards applied (CIS Benchmarks, vendor recommendations). |
| **Configuration Management** | Automated via Ansible for Linux, Intune for Windows. |
| **Baseline Enforcement** | AppArmor for Linux, Windows Group Policy for servers and desktops. |

---

### **4.2 Secure System Implementation**

All enterprise systems must be deployed with **secure configurations**:

| **System** | **Hardening Method** |
|------------|------------------|
| **Windows Desktops** | Intune policy enforcement, automatic updates via Win-Get. |
| **Windows Servers** | Hardened via auditing, automatic updates via Ansible and Win-Get. |
| **Linux Servers** | Configured via Ansible, AppArmor, and apt-get for security updates. |

---

### **4.3 DNS Security & Filtering**

DNS filtering is enforced using **Technitium DNS with blocklists**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Centralized DNS Control** | Technitium syncs slave zones from domain controllers. |
| **Malicious Domain Blocking** | DNS blocklists enforced, covering malware, advertising, and newly registered domains. |
| **Traffic Monitoring** | DNS logs monitored for suspicious activity. |

---

### **4.4 Domain & Email Security**

All domains and email infrastructure must follow strict security controls:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Domain Security** | DKIM, DMARC, and DNSSEC enabled and monitored. |
| **Email Security** | All email routed through Azure/Exchange Online with phishing and malware filtering. |
| **Compliance Monitoring** | Automated tools verify DKIM, DMARC, and DNSSEC integrity. |

---

### **4.5 Configuration Monitoring & Compliance**

All secure configurations must be **continuously monitored**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Automated Compliance Checks** | Systems monitored for drift and corrected via Ansible. |
| **Audit Logs** | Configuration changes logged and reviewed weekly. |
| **Policy Updates** | Configurations updated when significant security changes occur. |
