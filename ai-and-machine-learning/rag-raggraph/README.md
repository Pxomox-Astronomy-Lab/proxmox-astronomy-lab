# üîç **RAG and Graph Systems**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation infrastructure combining vector databases, graph databases, and advanced knowledge discovery capabilities for enhanced astronomical research and AI-powered analysis.

## **Overview**

This directory contains the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and graph-based knowledge systems that enhance AI capabilities across the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. By combining vector similarity search, graph relationships, and intelligent retrieval, these systems provide sophisticated knowledge discovery and context-aware AI assistance for astronomical research workflows.

**Primary Focus**: Hybrid RAG systems that leverage both vector embeddings and graph relationships to provide comprehensive, context-aware information retrieval and generation capabilities.

## **üìÇ Directory Contents**

### **Subdirectories**

| **Directory** | **Purpose** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **[documentation-rag/](documentation-rag/)** | RAG system for intelligent documentation search and knowledge discovery | [documentation-rag/README.md](documentation-rag/README.md) |
| **[vector-databases/](vector-databases/)** | Vector database infrastructure for similarity search and embedding operations | [vector-databases/README.md](vector-databases/README.md) |
| **[graph-databases/](graph-databases/)** | Graph database systems for knowledge graphs and relationship modeling | [graph-databases/README.md](graph-databases/README.md) |

## **Current Implementation**

### **Hybrid RAG Architecture**

- **Vector Search**: Milvus and pgvector for semantic similarity retrieval
- **Graph Relationships**: Neo4j for complex relationship queries and knowledge discovery
- **Combined Retrieval**: Hybrid search combining vector similarity and graph traversal
- **Context Enhancement**: Multi-modal retrieval for comprehensive answer generation

### **Knowledge Discovery Pipeline**

- **Multi-Source Indexing**: Documentation, research data, and procedural knowledge
- **Relationship Mapping**: Automatic discovery of connections between concepts and entities
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Intelligent selection of relevant information for query context
- **Answer Generation**: AI-powered response generation with proper source attribution

## **Key Features**

- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Advanced search combining semantic similarity and relationship understanding
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Rich modeling of relationships between astronomical concepts and research elements
- **Documentation Intelligence**: Sophisticated search and discovery across lab documentation
- **Research Assistance**: AI-powered support for complex astronomical research questions
