# 🎭 **Simulation Approach**

## 🔍 **1. Overview**

The Proxmox Astronomy Lab employs a **structured simulation approach** to replicate enterprise IT practices within a citizen science environment. This approach allows a **single operator to experience and implement enterprise-grade processes**, creating a realistic learning environment while maintaining rigorous operational standards.

### **1.1 Key Benefits**

| **Benefit** | **Description** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Role Experience** | Experience multiple IT roles and responsibilities |
| **Process Practice** | Implement ITIL processes in a controlled environment |
| **Documentation Development** | Create realistic documentation from each role perspective |
| **Skill Building** | Develop enterprise-grade skills applicable to professional environments |
| **Governance Testing** | Test governance models without organizational complexity |

---

## 🧩 **2. Simulation Philosophy**

Our simulation philosophy centers around the concept of a **"skill nexus"** - a multidisciplinary learning environment where technical decisions ripple across various IT domains.

| **Traditional Enterprise** | **Proxmox Astronomy Lab Simulation** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Siloed teams with specialized focus | Single operator rotating through multiple roles |
| Knowledge gaps between domains | Comprehensive cross-domain understanding |
| Trade-offs negotiated between teams | Direct experience of all trade-off consequences |
| Documentation for others | Documentation that serves both as reference and learning tool |

This approach creates a **unique educational environment** where every technical decision is viewed through multiple professional lenses simultaneously.

## 👥 **3. Simulated Roles & Responsibilities**

### **3.1 Primary Roles**

The lab simulates a small enterprise team structure with defined roles, each with distinct responsibilities:

| **Role** | **Primary Responsibilities** | **Documentation** |
|----------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Lab Owner** | Strategic direction, budgeting, final approval authority | [Lab Owner Role](role-simulation/lab-owner-role/README.md) |
| **Engineer** | Infrastructure design, complex technical implementation | [Engineer Role](role-simulation/engineer-role/README.md) |
| **Operations** | Day-to-day management, monitoring, stability | [Operations Role](role-simulation/operations-role/README.md) |
| **Administrator** | Security, compliance, access control | [Administrator Role](role-simulation/administrator-role/README.md) |
| **Helpdesk** | Documentation, tier 1 support, knowledge management | [Helpdesk Role](role-simulation/helpdesk-role/README.md) |

### **3.2 Role Rotation Schedule**

To maintain the simulation's effectiveness, roles are rotated according to:

- **Project Phase Focus** - Different roles lead different project phases
- **Calendar-Based Rotation** - Specific days dedicated to specific roles
- **Issue-Based Assignment** - Certain issue types handled by appropriate roles

This ensures balanced attention across all aspects of the environment.

## 🔄 **4. ITIL Process Simulation**

The lab implements lightweight ITIL processes to structure IT operations while maintaining practicality for a single operator.

### **4.1 Service Management**

| **ITIL Practice** | **Implementation Approach** | **Documentation** |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Service Catalog Management** | Structured service documentation using templates | [Service Documentation Template](../service-catalog/service-documentation-template.md) |
| **Service Level Management** | Defined SLOs for key services with monitoring | [Service Level Objectives](../service-catalog/service-level-objectives.md) |
| **Service Request Management** | Formalized request catalog in GLPI | [Service Request Catalog](../service-catalog/service-request-catalog.md) |

### **4.2 Change Management**

The lab simulates formal Change Advisory Board (CAB) processes:

| **Component** | **Simulation Method** | **Documentation** |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Virtual CAB Members** | Separate GLPI accounts representing different stakeholders | [CAB Member Profiles](../change-management/cab-member-profiles.md) |
| **Change Request Workflow** | Structured templates with risk assessment and rollback plans | [Change Request Process](../change-management/change-request-process.md) |
| **Change Evaluation** | Formal review process with multiple "approvers" | [Change Evaluation Criteria](../change-management/change-evaluation-criteria.md) |
| **Post-Implementation Review** | Structured assessment of implemented changes | [Post-Implementation Review Template](../change-management/pir-template.md) |

### **4.3 Incident Management**

| **Component** | **Simulation Method** | **Documentation** |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Severity Levels** | Defined P1-P4 classification with response targets | [Incident Severity Definitions](../incident-management/incident-severity-definitions.md) |
| **Incident Response** | Role-appropriate handling based on severity | [Incident Response Procedures](../incident-management/incident-response-procedures.md) |
| **Major Incident Process** | Escalation procedures for critical issues | [Major Incident Process](../incident-management/major-incident-process.md) |

## 🎫 **5. Ticketing System Implementation**

GLPI serves as the central platform for simulating enterprise ticketing processes.

### **5.1 Ticket Types & Workflows**

| **Ticket Type** | **Purpose** | **Workflow** |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Incident** | Track service disruptions and issues | Detection → Classification → Resolution → Closure |
| **Service Request** | Handle standard user requests | Submission → Approval → Fulfillment → Verification |
| **Change Request** | Manage changes to services or infrastructure | Proposal → Assessment → Approval → Implementation → Review |
| **Problem** | Address underlying causes of incidents | Identification → Investigation → Resolution → Prevention |

### **5.2 Virtual User Accounts**

The ticketing system is populated with virtual accounts representing:

- **CAB Members** - For change approval simulation
- **Department Stakeholders** - For service request approvals
- **Technical Specialists** - For escalation scenarios
- **Service Owners** - For accountability tracking

All virtual accounts use email forwarding with filtering to maintain the simulation while preventing excessive complexity.

## 🔐 **6. Compliance Integration**

The simulation approach integrates compliance requirements throughout:

| **Compliance Area** | **Simulation Approach** | **Documentation** |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **CISv8 Controls** | Role-specific responsibilities for implementing controls | [CISv8 RACI Matrix](../../compliance-security/cisv8-controls/cisv8-raci-matrix.md) |
| **Audit Preparation** | Simulated audit scenarios with evidence collection | [Audit Preparation Process](../../compliance-security/lab-security-policies/audit-preparation-process.md) |

## 📋 **7. Practical Implementation Examples**

### **7.1 Example: Database Change Implementation**

This illustrates how a single change flows through the simulated roles:

1. **Engineer** (Proposing Role):
   - Identifies need for TimescaleDB optimization
   - Creates change request in GLPI
   - Completes technical implementation plan

2. **Administrator** (Review Role):
   - Reviews security implications
   - Verifies compliance with standards
   - Provides security approval

3. **Operations** (Review Role):
   - Assesses operational impact
   - Reviews monitoring requirements
   - Provides operational approval

4. **CAB** (Virtual Approval):
   - Final review of complete change package
   - Formal approval with implementation window

5. **Engineer** (Implementation):
   - Executes the approved change
   - Documents results in GLPI

6. **Operations** (Verification):
   - Confirms successful implementation
   - Updates monitoring as needed

### **7.2 Example: Simulated Incident Response**

1. **Monitoring Alert** triggers incident ticket
2. **Helpdesk** performs initial triage
3. **Operations** investigates and resolves
4. **Engineer** conducts root cause analysis
5. **Administrator** verifies security impact
6. **Lab Owner** reviews major incidents
