# üèóÔ∏è **Multi-Tier Documentation Architecture**

This document provides comprehensive multi-tier documentation architecture framework for the Proxmox Astronomy Lab, establishing organizational hierarchy from enterprise organization through lab infrastructure to individual research projects, supporting systematic knowledge management through git submodule integration and unified ReadTheDocs publication enabling seamless navigation across organizational, infrastructure, and project domains while maintaining repository autonomy and specialized content development.

## **Overview**

The multi-tier documentation architecture provides systematic organizational hierarchy through three distinct tiers: **Organization Tier** containing enterprise-level documentation and strategic guidance, **Lab Tier** encompassing infrastructure documentation and operational procedures, and **Project Tier** including individual research repositories and specialized scientific computing documentation. This architecture supports the planned unified documentation strategy through git submodule integration enabling centralized publication while maintaining repository autonomy and domain-specific expertise.

Multi-tier implementation establishes foundation for future unified documentation system where individual repositories maintain their own documentation autonomy while contributing to comprehensive organizational knowledge base through systematic git submodule integration, ReadTheDocs publication, and hierarchical content organization supporting seamless knowledge discovery across enterprise organization, lab infrastructure, and individual research projects throughout scientific computing operations and infrastructure development.
