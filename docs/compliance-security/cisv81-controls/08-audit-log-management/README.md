# **ðŸ“œ README - CIS Control 8: Audit Log Management**

## **1. Introduction**

Audit log management is a **critical security control** for detecting anomalies, responding to incidents, and ensuring compliance with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**. **CIS Control 8** requires that all enterprise assets generate, store, and analyze logs to support **security monitoring and forensic investigations**.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** implements a **centralized logging system** that ensures **secure, structured, and auditable** log management.

| **Key Audit Log Features** | **Implementation** |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| **Centralized Logging** | Prometheus, Loki, and Alert Manager stack for log aggregation. |
| **Audit Policy Enforcement** | Auditd (Linux) and Windows Event Logging configured across all systems. |
| **Time Synchronization** | All systems synced to `us.pool.ntp.org` via Chrony (Linux) or Windows Time Service. |
| **Retention & Security** | Logs retained for **90 days** and stored on separate protected partitions. |
| **Automated Monitoring** | Anomaly detection via Wazuh SIEM and Prometheus Alert Manager. |

## **2. Scope**

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | All logs generated by servers, applications, network devices, and DNS services. |
| **Out-of-Scope** | Non-production test environments with no security impact. |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 8, NIST 800-53 (AU-2), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.12.4). |

## **3. Log Management Implementation**

### **Log Collection & Centralization**

All security-relevant logs are aggregated for real-time monitoring and forensic analysis.

| **Logging Source** | **Method of Collection** |
|------------------|----------------------|
| **System Logs (Linux/Windows)** | Shipped to Loki using Promtail & Winlogbeat. |
| **DNS & AD Logs** | Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) and Technitium DNS logs. |
| **Application Logs** | Collected via Prometheus & custom log shippers. |
| **Security Events** | Wazuh SIEM ingests logs for automated alerting. |

### **Time Synchronization**

Ensuring all logs have **accurate timestamps** prevents event discrepancies.

| **System** | **Time Sync Method** |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Windows Servers** | Windows Time Service (`us.pool.ntp.org`). |
| **Linux Servers** | Chrony (`us.pool.ntp.org`). |
| **Enforcement** | Ansible automation for drift correction. |

### **Retention & Security**

Logs must be **protected from unauthorized modifications** and retained for investigations.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Retention Policy** | Logs stored for **90 days** with archiving options. |
| **Storage Protection** | Logs stored on dedicated, secured partitions. |
| **Access Controls** | RBAC ensures only authorized personnel can view logs. |
| **Secure Transmission** | Logs are encrypted in transit to prevent tampering. |

### **Log Review & Incident Response**

Regular log analysis is conducted to detect security anomalies and threats.

| **Review Method** | **Frequency** |
|------------------|--------------|
| **Automated Log Analysis** | Continuous (via Wazuh SIEM & Alert Manager). |
| **High-Severity Event Escalation** | Immediate (per incident response policy). |
| **Manual Log Reviews** | Weekly (admin team reviews key security logs). |
