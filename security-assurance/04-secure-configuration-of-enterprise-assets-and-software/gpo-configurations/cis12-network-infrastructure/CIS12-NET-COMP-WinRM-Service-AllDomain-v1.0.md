# üîí **CIS12-NET-COMP-WinRM-Service-AllDomain-v1.0**

## **WinRM Service Security Configuration**

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** July 28, 2025  
**GPO Type:** Computer Configuration  
**Target Systems:** All Domain-Joined Computers  
**CIS Control Alignment:** CIS v8 Control 12 (Network Infrastructure Management)

# üìã **1. Implementation Overview**

This Group Policy Object implements WinRM service security configuration for all domain-joined computers within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab enterprise environment. The GPO disables basic authentication, unencrypted traffic, and RunAs functionality for Windows Remote Management service to prevent credential exposure, enforce secure communication protocols, and eliminate privilege escalation vulnerabilities in remote management operations.

The configuration addresses critical remote management server security requirements by eliminating insecure authentication methods, preventing cleartext communication, and disabling RunAs functionality that could enable unauthorized privilege escalation essential for secure administrative service operations across the domain infrastructure.

# üîó **2. Dependencies & Relationships**

This section maps how the WinRM Service GPO integrates with Proxmox Astronomy Lab remote management infrastructure and secure service components.

```

## **3.2 Structure and Organization**

The WinRM Service GPO implements three critical remote management service security controls through registry modifications targeting Windows Remote Management service configuration:

### **WinRM Service Security Controls**

| **Security Control** | **Registry Path** | **Value Name** | **Configuration** | **Security Impact** |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Basic Authentication Disable** | `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Service` | `AllowBasic` | `0` (DWord) | Prevents WinRM service from accepting basic authentication, eliminating cleartext credential transmission |
| **Unencrypted Traffic Block** | `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Service` | `AllowUnencryptedTraffic` | `0` (DWord) | Prohibits unencrypted WinRM service communication, enforcing encrypted channel usage |
| **RunAs Functionality Disable** | `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Service` | `DisableRunAs` | `1` (DWord) | Disables RunAs credentials for WinRM service, preventing privilege escalation vulnerabilities |

### **Service Security Configuration**

| **Security Control** | **Enabled/Disabled** | **Behavior** | **Security Posture** |
|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Basic Authentication** | `0` (Disabled) | No basic auth accepted | **Secure** - Prevents credential exposure |
| **Unencrypted Traffic** | `0` (Disabled) | Only encrypted communication | **Secure** - Protects data in transit |
| **RunAs Functionality** | `1` (Disabled) | No RunAs credential usage | **Secure** - Prevents privilege escalation |

### **Implementation Verification**

| **Verification Method** | **Expected Result** | **Validation Command** |
|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Registry Validation** | All three values correctly configured | `Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Service" -Name "AllowBasic", "AllowUnencryptedTraffic", "DisableRunAs"` |
| **WinRM Service Configuration** | Insecure methods disabled | `winrm get winrm/config/service` |
| **Service Security Testing** | Only secure authentication and encrypted connections work | Test WinRM service connections with various security levels |

## **3.3 Integration and Procedures**

WinRM service security implementation follows systematic deployment through Group Policy targeting all domain-joined computers with comprehensive secure service validation.

### **Deployment Procedure**

1. **Pre-Deployment Assessment**
   - Verify domain infrastructure readiness and WinRM service dependencies
   - Confirm secure authentication infrastructure (Kerberos, certificates) for service
   - Validate remote management service workflows and administrative access patterns

2. **GPO Implementation**
   - Deploy GPO targeting All Domain Computers through Group Policy Management Console
   - Configure universal application across all domain-joined systems
   - Validate policy precedence and WinRM service configuration inheritance

3. **Post-Deployment Validation**
   - Force policy update on all domain systems
   - Verify registry modifications through administrative validation
   - Test secure WinRM service connectivity and administrative functionality

# üõ†Ô∏è **4. Management & Operations**

## **4.1 Lifecycle Management**

WinRM service security lifecycle management encompasses remote management service assessment, systematic deployment, operational monitoring, and continuous security validation based on remote service threat landscape evolution.

## **4.2 Monitoring & Quality Assurance**

**Monitoring Infrastructure:** All monitoring is handled by proj-mon01, the centralized monitoring stack consisting of Prometheus (metrics), Loki (logs), Grafana (visualization), AlertManager (alerting), and Grafana Alloy (metrics/logging agent). Monitoring philosophy follows "if it can be collected, we do" approach with comprehensive WinRM service authentication monitoring and secure connection validation.

## **4.3 Maintenance and Optimization**

WinRM service security maintenance encompasses regular service authentication configuration validation, secure communication assessment, remote service monitoring, and systematic security control verification for sustained remote service protection.

# üîí **5. Security & Compliance**

## **5.1 Security Framework Alignment**

**Security Disclaimer**: The WinRM service security configuration documented in this GPO represents a remote management service security baseline for Windows domain-joined systems. These configurations should be thoroughly tested in non-production environments before deployment. While these templates follow CIS Controls v8 network infrastructure management framework guidelines, organizations should validate WinRM service security compatibility with their specific remote management service requirements and administrative access workflows. The security research computing team maintains these configurations as implementation guidance rather than production security recommendations, and encourages consultation with dedicated security professionals for enterprise deployment validation.

|-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **18.10.89.2.1** | Basic authentication disable, encryption enforcement, RunAs disable | Prevent credential exposure, ensure secure service communication, eliminate privilege escalation |

## **5.2 Compliance Requirements**

WinRM service security compliance validation requires systematic policy application assessment and secure service communication monitoring through Group Policy RSoP reporting and remote service authentication validation to maintain secure WinRM service configuration posture.

# üìã **6. Backup & Recovery**

## **6.1 Protection Strategy**

WinRM service security configuration requires multi-tier protection strategy encompassing Group Policy backup, remote service configuration export, and secure communication baseline preservation.

### **Protection Tiers**

| **Tier** | **Scope** | **Method** | **Frequency** |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Tier 1** | GPO Backup | Group Policy Management Console backup | Daily automatic |
| **Tier 2** | WinRM Service Configuration Export** | PowerShell WinRM service configuration export | Weekly |
| **Tier 3** | Version Control** | Git repository with configuration tracking | Every change |
| **Tier 4** | Security Baseline** | Complete WinRM service security configuration archive | Monthly |

*Note: Iperius backup software is configured for systematic Windows infrastructure backup including Group Policy objects.*

## **6.2 Recovery Procedures**

Recovery procedures enable rapid WinRM service security baseline restoration through Group Policy import capabilities and remote service configuration restoration with priority focus on authentication hardening and encryption enforcement re-establishment.
