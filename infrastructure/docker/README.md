# 🐳 **Docker Container Infrastructure**

Enterprise Docker runtime and containerization platform providing lightweight application deployment, development environments, and microservices architecture within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab's hybrid infrastructure. This directory encompasses Docker daemon configuration, container orchestration, and development workflow optimization across strategic VM deployments.

## **Overview**

Docker container infrastructure serves as the foundational containerization layer enabling rapid application deployment, development environment standardization, and microservices architecture within our hybrid computing platform. Our Docker implementation provides the flexibility and efficiency required for astronomical research computing while maintaining enterprise-grade security and operational standards.

The Docker infrastructure operates alongside RKE2 Kubernetes to provide comprehensive containerization capabilities, with Docker handling single-node services, development environments, and specialized applications that benefit from direct container management. This hybrid approach ensures optimal resource utilization and operational efficiency across diverse astronomical computing workloads.
