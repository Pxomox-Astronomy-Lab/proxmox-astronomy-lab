# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-17 Incident Response Policy**

## **1. Purpose**

Incident response ensures that **security incidents, unauthorized access, operational failures, and external threats** are handled **efficiently and with minimal business disruption**. This policy defines **structured procedures for reporting, managing, and resolving incidents** within the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

## **2. Scope**

This policy applies to **all IT assets, network infrastructure, and cloud services**, as well as:

- **Internal and public-facing services**
- **Cloud-based environments (Azure, AWS)**
- **Critical lab infrastructure**

### **Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **structured incident response** through:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Incident Management Leadership** | Incidents are managed by the **Lead Engineer** and **Lab Owner**. |
| **Incident Reporting Methods** | Users report incidents via **Zammad Helpdesk, MS Teams, or phone (in order of priority)**. |
| **Incident Response Planning** | Defined **onboarding and offboarding policies** for security events. |
| **Cloud & Infrastructure Compliance** | **Azure & AWS compliance portals** provide extensive monitoring & documentation. |
| **Secure Incident Handling** | Entra ID integration for **identity-based incident response**. |
| **Periodic Incident Review** | Security incidents **reviewed monthly** to improve processes. |

This policy aligns with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**, ensuring **effective and auditable incident management**.

## **3. Responsibilities**

Roles and responsibilities ensure **proper enforcement of incident response policies**:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Lead Engineer (Incident Manager)** | Oversees incident response, assigns tasks, and ensures resolution. |
| **Lab Owner (Business Impact Lead)** | Assesses the impact of incidents and directs mitigation efforts. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Investigate, document, and resolve incidents using defined response processes. |
| **Users** | Report security incidents via Zammad, MS Teams, or phone (based on urgency). |

---

## **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Incident Response Planning & Documentation**

A formal **incident response process** must be **documented, maintained, and reviewed annually**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Incident Response Plan** | Defined **incident handling, containment, and resolution procedures**. |
| **Security Incident Notification** | All security incidents reported via **Zammad Helpdesk, MS Teams, or escalation phone call**. |

### **4.2 Incident Detection & Reporting**

Incidents must be **reported promptly using standardized procedures**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Primary Reporting Method** | **Zammad Helpdesk (helpdesk.beardinthe.cloud)** as the primary incident tracker. |
| **Alternative Reporting Methods** | MS Teams chat or direct phone call for urgent cases. |
| **Incident Escalation Process** | High-severity incidents reported **immediately to the Lead Engineer**. |

---

### **4.3 Incident Containment & Mitigation**
