# üéì **CISv8-14 Security Awareness Training Policy**

## üîç **1. Overview**

This policy establishes the framework for ensuring all lab personnel maintain appropriate cybersecurity knowledge through structured training programs. By implementing regular training and simulated security exercises, we cultivate a security-conscious environment that reduces risk and improves incident response capabilities.

### **1.1 Why This Policy Matters**

Security awareness training ensures that **all employees, contractors, and users understand cybersecurity risks and best practices** to protect enterprise assets. This policy establishes **structured training, phishing simulation exercises, and continuous updates** for **the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

### **1.2 Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **security awareness training** through multiple complementary mechanisms that work together to build a comprehensive security culture:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Onboarding Security Training** | All new users complete cybersecurity training before accessing enterprise assets. |
| **Annual Training** | Users receive **annual security awareness training** to reinforce best practices. |
| **Automated Phishing & Attack Simulations** | Conducted via **Microsoft Defender Security Awareness Training** and external services like KnowBe4, CyberHoot, or PhishFirewall. |
| **Data Security & Compliance** | Users trained on handling sensitive data and enterprise security policies. |
| **Incident Reporting & Response** | Users trained to recognize and report security threats and phishing attempts. |

This integrated approach ensures that security awareness becomes an integral part of our organizational culture rather than just a compliance exercise.

---

## üìä **2. Compliance Mapping**

Our security awareness training strategy aligns with multiple industry frameworks to ensure comprehensive coverage and best practices implementation. These mappings help demonstrate our security posture to stakeholders and ensure regulatory compliance.

The following table shows how this policy maps to established security frameworks:

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 14 ‚Äì Security Awareness Training |
| **NIST 800-53** | AT-2 ‚Äì Security Awareness Training |
| **ISO 27001** | A.7.2 ‚Äì Information Security Awareness, Education, and Training |

By aligning with these frameworks, we ensure our security awareness strategy meets industry standards while providing appropriate training for our environment.

---

## üë• **3. Responsibilities**

Effective security awareness training requires clear role definition and accountability across the organization. Each role has specific responsibilities that contribute to our overall security posture.

The following table outlines the primary responsibilities for implementing and maintaining our security awareness training program:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Deploy and manage phishing simulations, monitor compliance, and review training effectiveness. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Ensure all users complete required training and track security awareness progress. |
| **Users** | Complete security training, follow best practices, and report security incidents. |

This clear delineation of responsibilities ensures that security awareness remains a priority at all levels of the organization with appropriate oversight and execution.

## üìö **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Security Training Development & Implementation**

A comprehensive security training program forms the foundation of our security awareness strategy. This program must address both general security principles and threats specific to our environment.

The following table outlines our security training requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Onboarding Security Training** | All new users must complete security awareness training before gaining access to enterprise systems. |
| **Annual Cybersecurity Training** | All employees must complete an annual cybersecurity awareness training. |
| **Microsoft Defender Security Awareness** | Automated phishing and security simulations for ongoing awareness. |
| **Third-Party Training Platforms** | Additional training via KnowBe4, CyberHoot, or PhishFirewall as needed. |

This structured approach ensures that all personnel receive appropriate training at the right time, with regular reinforcement of key security concepts.

---

### **4.2 Security Awareness Topics Covered**

Our security awareness training must address a broad range of topics to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential threats and security best practices.

The following table outlines the key security topics included in our training program:

| **Topic** | **Training Coverage** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Social Engineering & Phishing** | How to recognize and report phishing attacks. |
| **Authentication Best Practices** | Use of strong passwords, MFA, and secure authentication methods. |
| **Data Protection & Compliance** | Proper handling, storing, and transferring of sensitive data. |
| **Clear Screen & Clean Desk Policies** | Importance of securing unattended systems and physical data. |
| **Incident Response** | How to identify and report security incidents. |
| **Security Updates & Patch Awareness** | The importance of updating systems and applying security patches. |
| **Safe Internet & Email Practices** | Risks of insecure networks and unsafe browsing habits. |

This comprehensive curriculum ensures that users understand both the technical and behavioral aspects of security.

---

### **4.3 Phishing Simulations & Attack Testing**

Theoretical knowledge must be reinforced with practical experience to be most effective. Our simulated security exercises provide this hands-on component of security awareness.

The following table outlines our approach to security simulations:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Phishing Simulations** | Conducted via **Microsoft Defender Security Awareness Training** and third-party platforms. |
| **Reporting & Metrics** | Results reviewed to improve awareness and user response times. |
| **Remedial Training** | Users who fail phishing tests are **automatically enrolled in additional training**. |

These simulations provide measurable data on security awareness while creating opportunities for targeted improvement.

---

### **4.4 Security Training Compliance & Tracking**

To ensure the effectiveness of our training program, we must maintain accurate records of training completion and compliance status.

The following table outlines our approach to compliance tracking:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Training Completion Tracking** | Monitored via enterprise LMS or security training platforms. |
| **Compliance Audits** | Security awareness compliance is reviewed **annually**. |
| **User Notifications** | Automated reminders sent for incomplete training. |

This structured tracking approach ensures accountability while providing the data needed to assess training effectiveness.

---

### **4.5 Security Awareness Training Updates**

Security threats evolve constantly, and our training program must adapt accordingly. Regular updates ensure that our training remains relevant and effective.

The following table outlines our approach to maintaining current training materials:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Annual Content Review** | Security training material is reviewed and updated yearly. |
| **Threat-Based Adjustments** | Training modified based on emerging security threats. |
| **User Feedback** | Employee feedback incorporated to improve effectiveness. |

This continuous improvement cycle ensures that our training program remains effective against evolving threats.
