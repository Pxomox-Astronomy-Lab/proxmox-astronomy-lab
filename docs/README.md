# 📚 Proxmox Astronomy Lab Documentation  

🚀 **Welcome to the official documentation hub for the Proxmox Astronomy Lab!**  

This is the **public portion** of our **actively maintained, in-use Wiki**, documenting everything from **troubleshooting guides and admin procedures** to **sanitized configurations, CISv8 security policies, and compliance efforts**. Unlike most projects that only release select documentation, we take a **fully transparent approach**, sharing as much as possible while maintaining **a structured private section for sensitive data**.  

📖 **This KB is a real, operational resource**—not just static documentation. It’s **actively used** for day-to-day operations, continuously updated as our infrastructure evolves, and structured to be **searchable, auditable, and AI-assisted**.  

🔹 *Curious about how we use AI in documentation?* → [Read more on AI Transparency and Ethical Use](#ai-transparency-and-ethical-use)  
🔹 *Looking for our radio astronomy projects and datasets?* → [Explore Observatory Projects and Datasets](#observatory-projects-and-datasets)

## 1. Security and Compliance 🔐  

**Security compliance** refers to the process of ensuring systems meet established best practices and security controls to **reduce risk, protect data, and defend against cyber threats**.  

For this lab, we have chosen **CISv8 (Center for Internet Security)** as a **practical, accessible security standard** to align with. We also **map** (but do not strictly follow) **NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, and DISA-STIG**, as Ubuntu 24.04 can meet many of these requirements. These mappings are provided for **educational purposes** and to **ensure security posture awareness**.  

📜 **Full Section:** [Security & Compliance](security-compliance/README.md)

## 2. Zero Trust Networking 🔒  

**Zero Trust Networking (ZTNA)** ensures that **no device, user, or application is automatically trusted**—every request must be verified and authorized.
