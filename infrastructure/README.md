# **Proxmox Astronomy Lab - Infrastructure Overview**

## **Introduction**

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** is a purpose-built hybrid research and IT environment that supports **radio astronomy, AI-driven signal processing, and structured IT operations**. Infrastructure plays a foundational role in ensuring that the lab is **scalable, high-performance, and secure** while maintaining the flexibility needed for continuous research.

This section provides a **detailed breakdown of the infrastructure**, from **compute resources and Kubernetes deployments** to **networking, storage, and observatory hardware**. Each component has been architected to balance **performance, modularity, and security**, ensuring that the lab can evolve alongside its research needs.

This is not a traditional **enterprise stack**, nor is it a **home lab with ad-hoc infrastructure**â€”it is a structured system that **blends DevOps methodologies, high-performance computing, and scientific instrumentation into a cohesive environment.**

### **Compute & Virtualization**

- **Proxmox Cluster** â†’ Five-node cluster supporting research workloads, virtualized infrastructure, and GPU-accelerated processing.
- **Kubernetes (RKE2)** â†’ A containerized workload environment optimized for ML/AI, automation, and scientific data pipelines.
- **GPU Workloads** â†’ Dedicated compute resources for AI-driven signal processing and astronomical data analysis.

### **Networking & Security**

- **VLAN-Segmented Architecture** â†’ Logical separation between control plane, research workloads, and observatory systems.
- **Zero-Trust Security** â†’ Enforced via **Entra ID, Conditional Access, and Tailscale**.
- **Hybrid Identity Management** â†’ Windows Server 2025 AD & Entra ID hybrid model with Azure Arc integration.

### **Storage & Data Management**

- **NVMe-Backed Object Storage** â†’ High-speed S3 gateway for research data and Kubernetes workloads.
- **PostgreSQL & TimescaleDB** â†’ Structured database solutions for astronomical data and signal storage.
- **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)** â†’ Daily snapshot-based backup strategy with offsite replication.

### **Observatory & Research Hardware**

- **Hydrogen Line Research Systems** â†’ Custom-built **radio astronomy hardware, antennas, and SDR receivers**.
- **Signal Processing Pipelines** â†’ AI-driven **noise reduction, signal validation, and long-term data retention**.
- **Scientific Data Integration** â†’ Federated research approach leveraging public datasets alongside lab-collected data.
