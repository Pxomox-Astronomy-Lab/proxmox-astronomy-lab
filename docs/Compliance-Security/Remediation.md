# 🔧 **Security Remediation**

## 🔍 **1. Overview**

This section documents the **remediation processes, tools, and automation** used to address security findings and maintain compliance in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. Our approach emphasizes **efficient, repeatable corrections** that strengthen security posture while minimizing operational impact.

Our remediation strategy combines **automated solutions, documented procedures, and verification mechanisms** to ensure timely resolution of security issues. This documentation provides resources for addressing compliance gaps, vulnerability findings, and security enhancement opportunities.

## 🛠️ **2. Remediation Components**

Our security remediation framework consists of several key components:

| **Component** | **Purpose** | **Implementation** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [**Ansible Playbooks**](Ansible-Playbooks/README.md) | Automated configuration and remediation | Infrastructure as Code | [Playbook Guide](Ansible-Playbooks/playbook-guide.md) |
| [**Scripts**](Scripts/README.md) | Targeted issue resolution | Bash, PowerShell, Python scripts | [Script Usage](Scripts/usage-guide.md) |
| [**Exceptions**](Exceptions/README.md) | Documented deviations with compensating controls | Formal exception process | [Exception Management](Exceptions/management-process.md) |

These components work together to provide a systematic approach to security remediation across our environment.

## 📊 **3. Remediation Process**

### **3.1 Issue Identification to Resolution**

Our remediation follows a structured workflow:

| **Stage** | **Activities** | **Tools** | **Documentation** |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Detection** | Security findings from assessment tools | CIS-CAT Lite, Lynis, Wazuh | [Detection Process](detection-process.md) |
| **Prioritization** | Risk-based ranking of issues | CVSS scoring, business impact analysis | [Prioritization Framework](prioritization-framework.md) |
| **Solution Development** | Creation of remediation approaches | Ansible development, scripting | [Solution Development](solution-development.md) |
| **Testing** | Validation in test environment | Lab testing, verification scripts | [Testing Procedures](testing-procedures.md) |
| **Implementation** | Applying solutions to production | Change management process | [Implementation Procedures](implementation-procedures.md) |
| **Verification** | Confirmation of successful remediation | Validation scripts, rescanning | [Verification Methods](verification-methods.md) |

This lifecycle ensures a methodical approach to addressing security issues with appropriate controls and verification.

### **3.2 Remediation Timeframes**

Issue resolution follows risk-based timeframes:

| **Severity** | **Resolution Timeframe** | **Escalation Point** | **Example Issues** |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | 24-48 hours | Immediate lab owner notification | Remote code execution vulnerabilities |
| **High** | 7 days | Daily status updates | Authentication bypass, privilege escalation |
| **Medium** | 30 days | Weekly status updates | Security misconfigurations, outdated software |
| **Low** | 90 days | Monthly status updates | Non-critical compliance findings |

These timeframes ensure appropriate response based on risk while maintaining operational stability.

## 🤖 **4. Automation Components**

### **4.1 Ansible Automation**

Ansible automation is our primary remediation tool:

| **Playbook Category** | **Purpose** | **Documentation** |
|-----------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **CIS Hardening** | Automated application of CIS benchmarks | [CIS Playbooks](Ansible-Playbooks/cis-hardening/README.md) |
| **Vulnerability Remediation** | Common vulnerability fixes | [Vulnerability Playbooks](Ansible-Playbooks/vulnerability-fixes/README.md) |
| **Configuration Management** | Baseline configuration enforcement | [Configuration Playbooks](Ansible-Playbooks/configuration/README.md) |
| **Compliance Verification** | Post-remediation validation | [Verification Playbooks](Ansible-Playbooks/verification/README.md) |

These playbooks provide repeatable, consistent remediation across multiple systems while maintaining documentation of changes.

### **4.2 Remediation Scripts**

Targeted scripts address specific scenarios:

| **Script Category** | **Purpose** | **Implementation** |
|--------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Linux Hardening** | System-specific security fixes | Bash scripts with verification checks |
| **Windows Security** | Windows Server security adjustments | PowerShell scripts with logging |
| **Application Fixes** | Application-specific remediation | Python scripts with application API integration |
| **Verification Scripts** | Independent validation of fixes | Shell scripts with detailed reporting |

These scripts supplement Ansible automation for scenarios requiring specialized handling.

## 📝 **5. Exception Management**

### **5.1 Exception Process**

When remediation is not immediately possible, we follow a structured exception process:

| **Step** | **Activities** | **Documentation** |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Request** | Formal documentation of exception need | [Exception Request Form](Exceptions/exception-request-template.md) |
| **Risk Assessment** | Evaluation of security impact | [Risk Assessment Methodology](Exceptions/risk-assessment.md) |
| **Compensating Controls** | Implementation of alternative protections | [Control Development](Exceptions/compensating-controls.md) |
| **Approval** | Formal signoff by lab owner | [Approval Process](Exceptions/approval-process.md) |
| **Documentation** | Recording of exception details | [Exception Register](Exceptions/register.md) |
| **Periodic Review** | Regular reassessment of exceptions | [Review Schedule](Exceptions/review-schedule.md) |

This process ensures all exceptions are properly evaluated, documented, and regularly reviewed.

### **5.2 Current Exceptions**

The lab maintains detailed records of approved exceptions:

| **Exception Category** | **Count** | **Review Frequency** | **Documentation** |
|------------------------|----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Technical Limitations** | 3 | Quarterly | [Technical Exceptions](Exceptions/technical-exceptions.md) |
| **Operational Requirements** | 2 | Quarterly | [Operational Exceptions](Exceptions/operational-exceptions.md) |
| **Risk Acceptance** | 1 | Monthly | [Risk Exceptions](Exceptions/risk-exceptions.md) |

For detailed information on specific exceptions, see the [Exception Register](Exceptions/register.md).

## 📊 **6. Metrics & Reporting**

### **6.1 Remediation Metrics**

Performance metrics track remediation effectiveness:

- **Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)** - Average time from detection to resolution
- **First-pass success rate** - Percentage of issues resolved without rework
- **Compliance improvement** - Change in overall compliance scores after remediation
- **Automation coverage** - Percentage of issues addressed through automation
- **Exception ratio** - Percentage of findings with approved exceptions

These metrics provide quantitative measurement of the remediation program's effectiveness.

### **6.2 Reporting**

Regular reporting provides visibility into remediation status:

| **Report Type** | **Audience** | **Frequency** | **Content** |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Remediation Dashboard** | Lab Owner, Security Admin | Real-time | Current status of all remediation activities |
| **Progress Report** | Lab Owner | Weekly | Completed actions, pending items, blockers |
| **Compliance Trend** | All Roles | Monthly | Long-term compliance improvement trends |
| **Exception Report** | Lab Owner, Security Admin | Monthly | Current exceptions and review status |
