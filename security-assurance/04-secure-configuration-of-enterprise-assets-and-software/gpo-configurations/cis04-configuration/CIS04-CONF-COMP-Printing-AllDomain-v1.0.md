# 🔐 **CIS04-CONF-COMP-Printing-AllDomain-v1.0**

This document provides comprehensive configuration details for the Print Service security hardening Group Policy Object, implementing CIS Control 4 (Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software) through comprehensive Print Spooler protection, RPC security, and Point-and-Print restrictions across all domain-joined computers in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab infrastructure.

# 🎯 **1. Introduction**

This section establishes the foundational context for Print Service security configuration within the enterprise Windows hardening framework.

## **1.1 Purpose**

This subsection explains how the Printing GPO contributes to systematic security hardening by controlling print service vulnerabilities and reducing attack surface through comprehensive print security management.

The Printing GPO implements critical security controls for Windows Print Spooler and related print services, addressing numerous attack vectors including PrintNightmare vulnerabilities, RPC exploitation, and unauthorized driver installations. This configuration ensures that print service operations maintain security boundaries while supporting legitimate printing workflows essential for enterprise operations, providing comprehensive protection against print service-based attacks that have become prevalent threat vectors.

## **1.2 Scope**

This subsection defines the boundaries of Print Service security configuration within the Windows Server 2025 security baseline implementation.

The GPO applies comprehensive print service security controls to all domain-joined computers across the infrastructure, targeting Windows Print Spooler functionality, RPC communication, driver installation procedures, and Point-and-Print operations through Administrative Template and registry policy enforcement. The configuration scope encompasses redirection guard protection, RPC security hardening, queue file management, driver installation restrictions, and Point-and-Print elevation controls, providing systematic protection against print service attack vectors while maintaining operational functionality for approved printing operations.

# 🔗 **2. Dependencies & Relationships**
