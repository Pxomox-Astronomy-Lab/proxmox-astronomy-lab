This subsection details backup approaches, schedules, and retention policies implemented across hybrid Kubernetes and VM infrastructure.

**Comprehensive Multi-Tier Backup Strategy:** Data protection encompasses systematic backup across all infrastructure layers with automated scheduling, retention management, and offsite replication ensuring comprehensive protection for virtual machines, databases, and configuration data supporting astronomical research operations and compliance requirements.

**Backup Implementation by Platform:**

| **Platform Type** | **Backup Solution** | **Schedule** | **Retention** | **Offsite Strategy** |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Linux VMs** | **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)** | **Weekly: 4 backups, Monthly: 1 backup** | **30 days** | **Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** |
| **Windows VMs** | **Veeam Backup & Replication Community** | **Weekly: 4 backups, Monthly: 1 backup** | **30 days** | **Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** |
| **Database Systems** | **Iperius Backup** | **Weekly: 4 backups, Monthly: 1 backup** | **30 days** | **Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** |
| **Configuration Data** | **Git + Infrastructure Backup** | **Continuous + Weekly** | **30 days local, 12 months offsite** | **Repository replication + S3** |

All backup data encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption with keys managed through centralized key management system.

## **6.2 Recovery Procedures**

This subsection provides recovery processes for different failure scenarios across the hybrid infrastructure.

**Tiered Recovery Strategy:** Recovery procedures are organized by scope and urgency, from individual service restoration to full infrastructure rebuild. All recovery operations are documented with step-by-step procedures and tested quarterly during scheduled maintenance windows.

**Recovery Scenarios:**

- **Individual VM Recovery:** Proxmox VE restore from PBS snapshots or Veeam backup with automated integrity verification
- **Database Point-in-Time Recovery:** Iperius backup restoration with transaction consistency validation  
- **Kubernetes Service Recovery:** PV snapshot restoration with pod recreation and service validation
- **Complete Site Recovery:** Infrastructure-as-Code deployment with automated service restoration and data synchronization
- **Configuration Rollback:** Git-based configuration management with automated rollback and validation testing

**Recovery Validation:** All recovery operations include automated validation testing to ensure data integrity, service functionality, and performance baseline compliance before declaring recovery complete.
