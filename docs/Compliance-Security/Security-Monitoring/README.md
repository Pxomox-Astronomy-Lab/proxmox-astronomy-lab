# 🔍 **Security Monitoring**

## 🔍 **1. Overview**

This section documents the **security monitoring infrastructure, configuration, and operational procedures** implemented in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. Our monitoring approach provides **comprehensive visibility into security events, compliance status, and potential threats** across the lab environment.

The security monitoring solution combines **centralized log collection, automated compliance verification, and active threat detection** to ensure timely identification of security issues. This documentation covers the technical implementation, operational procedures, and integration with other security components.

## 🔭 **2. Monitoring Architecture**

### **2.1 Core Components**

Our security monitoring architecture consists of several integrated components:

| **Component** | **Purpose** | **Implementation** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [**Wazuh SIEM**](Wazuh/README.md) | Security event monitoring and response | Centralized on lab-soc01 | [Wazuh Configuration](Wazuh/configuration.md) |
| [**Log Management**](Log-Management/README.md) | Centralized logging and analysis | Loki + Grafana integration | [Log Collection](Log-Management/collection.md) |
| [**Compliance Scanning**](Compliance-Scanning/README.md) | Automated compliance verification | CIS-CAT Lite, custom checks | [Scanning Configuration](Compliance-Scanning/configuration.md) |
| [**Vulnerability Management**](Vulnerability-Management/README.md) | Vulnerability tracking and remediation | Integrated vulnerability workflow | [Vulnerability Process](Vulnerability-Management/process.md) |

These components work together to provide comprehensive security visibility across the lab environment.

### **2.2 Architectural Diagram**

The security monitoring infrastructure follows a hub-and-spoke model:

- **Central monitoring servers** (lab-soc01, lab-mon01) collect and analyze security data
- **Distributed agents** on all managed systems collect and forward security information
- **Integration points** with related security systems enhance correlation capabilities
- **Visualization dashboards** provide actionable security insights

For detailed architecture information, see the [Security Architecture](../Security-Policies/Architecture/README.md) documentation.

This automated approach ensures continuous visibility into compliance status.

### **4.2 Compliance Reporting**

Compliance status is reported through multiple channels:

| **Report Type** | **Audience** | **Frequency** | **Content** |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Compliance Dashboard** | Security Team | Real-time | Current compliance status by system |
| **Trend Analysis** | Lab Owner | Weekly | Compliance trends over time |
| **Detailed Reports** | System Administrators | Weekly | System-specific findings and remediation guidance |
| **Executive Summary** | Lab Owner | Monthly | Overall compliance posture and key metrics |

These reports provide actionable information for maintaining security compliance.

## 📝 **5. Log Management**

### **5.1 Log Collection Architecture**

The lab implements a comprehensive log collection infrastructure:

| **Log Source Type** | **Collection Method** | **Retention Period** | **Analysis Tools** |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **System Logs** | Wazuh agents, syslog forwarding | 180 days | Wazuh decoders, Grafana dashboards |
| **Security Logs** | Wazuh agents, direct collection | one year | Wazuh rules, custom analytics |
| **Application Logs** | Application-specific forwarders | 90 days | Custom parsers, pattern matching |
| **Authentication Logs** | Wazuh agents, direct collection | one year | Authentication analytics, anomaly detection |

This multi-layered approach ensures comprehensive log visibility while maintaining compliance with retention requirements.

### **5.2 Log Analysis Capabilities**

Collected logs undergo detailed analysis:

| **Analysis Type** | **Implementation** | **Use Cases** |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Pattern Matching** | Wazuh rules, log parsers | Known threat identification |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Statistical analysis, behavioral baseline | Zero-day threat detection |
| **Correlation Analysis** | Multi-source event correlation | Complex attack chain identification |
| **Compliance Verification** | Policy-based log checking | Regulatory requirement validation |

These capabilities transform raw log data into actionable security intelligence.

## 🛡️ **6. Vulnerability Management**

### **6.1 Vulnerability Detection**

Vulnerabilities are detected through multiple mechanisms:

| **Detection Method** | **Coverage** | **Frequency** | **Documentation** |
|----------------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Wazuh Vulnerability Detector** | OS packages, applications | Daily | [Wazuh Vulnerability Scanning](Vulnerability-Management/wazuh-vulnerability-scanning.md) |

| **Medium** | Security policy violations, suspicious activity | <8 hours | Addition to daily security report |
| **Low** | Informational alerts, minor violations | <24 hours | Addition to weekly security report |

This prioritization ensures appropriate response to different alert types.

### **7.2 Alert Response Procedures**

Standard procedures guide response to security alerts:
