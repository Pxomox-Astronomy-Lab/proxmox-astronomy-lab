# **ðŸ“œ README - CIS Control 13: Network Monitoring and Defense**

## **1. Introduction**

Effective **network monitoring and defense** are essential for **detecting security threats, preventing unauthorized access, and enforcing segmentation policies**. **CIS Control 13** mandates that all network activity is **monitored, logged, and analyzed** to ensure **secure and compliant network operations**.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** employs **real-time network monitoring, logging, and segmentation controls** to comply with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

| **Key Network Security Features** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Traffic Monitoring & Logging** | Wazuh and Loki deployed for real-time monitoring. |
| **VLAN Segmentation & Access Control** | Strict VLAN policies enforce network isolation. |
| **Restricted Remote Access** | No direct external access permitted to lab resources. |
| **Hardware Security & Detection** | Network policies enforced on labswitch01 and labswitch02. |
| **Continuous Review & Auditing** | Policies reviewed and updated monthly. |

## **2. Scope**

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | All network devices, monitoring tools, and access control policies governing VLANs and segmentation. |
| **Out-of-Scope** | Temporary lab networks and isolated test environments. |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 13, NIST 800-53 (SC-7), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.13.1). |

## **3. Network Security Implementation**

### **Traffic Monitoring & Logging**

All network activity is continuously **logged and analyzed** for anomalies and security threats.

| **Security Measure** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Traffic Analysis** | Wazuh and Loki deployed for real-time monitoring. |
| **Alerting & Detection** | Suspicious activity generates security alerts. |
| **Log Retention** | Logs stored for **90 days** for forensic investigation. |

### **VLAN Segmentation & Access Control**

Strict VLAN policies enforce **network segmentation and prevent lateral movement**.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **VLAN Segmentation** | VLAN-to-VLAN communication restricted based on security policies. |
| **Firewall Policy Enforcement** | FortiGate firewall rules enforce traffic control. |
| **Logging & Alerts** | Unauthorized VLAN traffic is flagged for review. |

### **Remote Access Security & Physical Network Controls**

Access to internal systems is **strictly limited** to enforce **Zero Trust principles**.

| **Security Measure** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Remote Access Restriction** | No direct external access to lab resources. |
| **Jump Box Enforcement** | Access restricted via Entra Private Access (EPA) & MFA. |
| **Unauthorized Device Detection** | Alerts generated for unapproved network devices. |

### **Policy Review & Continuous Improvement**

Network security policies are **continuously reviewed and updated** to maintain compliance.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Security Policy Review** | Policies reviewed on a **monthly basis**. |
| **Log Analysis & Incident Response** | Logs analyzed for security trends and misconfigurations. |
| **Compliance Monitoring** | Regular audits ensure compliance with CIS benchmarks. |
