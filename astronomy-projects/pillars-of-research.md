# Research Pillars

The Proxmox Astronomy Lab is guided by three foundational pillars that shape our approach to astronomical research, infrastructure development, and community contribution. These principles ensure our computational resources drive meaningful scientific discovery while advancing the broader astronomical research community.

## üî¨ Science with Purpose

We focus exclusively on research projects with high probability of significant community contribution - whether through groundbreaking discoveries, foundational datasets, or peer-reviewed publications that advance astronomical knowledge.

**What this means:**

- Every project must produce tangible outputs: papers, Value-Added Catalogs (VACs), or datasets that benefit the scientific community
- We prioritize research addressing fundamental astrophysical questions with clear impact potential
- Projects are selected based on their contribution to ongoing scientific debates or their ability to open new research avenues

**Current examples:**

- **DESI Cosmic Void Galaxy Analysis**: Definitive measurement of environmental quenching using unprecedented statistical power
- **DESI Quasar Anomaly Detection**: Systematic search for rare phenomena in 1.6M quasar spectra
- **Quasar Outflow Energetics Survey**: First large-scale statistical sample of AGN feedback measurements

## üéØ Discovery Hunters

We actively pursue research opportunities with discovery potential, balancing "safe bet" projects that guarantee community-valuable outputs with higher-risk initiatives that could yield transformational findings.

**What this means:**

- Portfolio approach: Mix of low-risk/medium-impact and high-risk/high-impact projects
- Systematic search for "unknown unknowns" - phenomena not accounted for in existing models
- Even failed high-risk projects often produce valuable side data and methodology improvements
- Willingness to explore new computational approaches and analysis techniques

**Risk portfolio balance:**

- **Low Risk/Medium Impact**: Statistical studies using established catalogs and proven methods
- **Medium Risk/High Impact**: Scaling proven techniques to unprecedented sample sizes
- **High Risk/High Impact**: Unsupervised discovery missions searching for entirely new phenomena

## üåê Open Science / Open IT

We share an unprecedented level of transparency about our infrastructure design, scientific methodology, and operational practices - going far beyond traditional academic openness.

**What this means:**

- **Complete Infrastructure Transparency**: Detailed documentation of our cluster design, security implementation, performance optimization, and operational procedures
- **Reproducible Research**: All analysis code, database schemas, and computational environments are documented and shareable
- **Security Posture Documentation**: Our CIS compliance implementation and security framework serve as a reference for other research labs
- **Performance Analytics**: Grafana dashboards and optimization strategies are shared to help others maximize their computational resources

**Unprecedented sharing includes:**

- Hardware specifications down to cable management and power distribution
- Complete software stack deployment guides and automation scripts
- Security baseline implementation with CIS Controls v8 compliance documentation
- Real-world performance metrics under actual scientific workloads
- ETL pipeline designs and database optimization strategies

## Strategic Implementation

These pillars work together to create a coherent research strategy:

1. **Science with Purpose** ensures we tackle meaningful problems
2. **Discovery Hunters** drives us toward breakthrough potential
3. **Open Science/Open IT** maximizes our community impact and enables others to build on our work

Our current DESI project portfolio exemplifies this approach - combining guaranteed community value (environmental quenching measurements) with discovery potential (anomalous quasar detection) while documenting every aspect of our computational infrastructure and analysis methodology for community benefit.

## The Vision

Our ultimate goal is to create a **reproducible astronomy research lab as code** - where the entire infrastructure, methodology, and active research projects can be deployed by other institutions. This transforms how astronomical research infrastructure is shared and enables smaller departments to leverage our proven computational and analytical frameworks for their own discoveries.
