# üîç **CISv8-13 Network Monitoring and Defense Policy**

## üéØ **1. Purpose**

This policy establishes the framework for comprehensive network visibility and defense, ensuring that security events are detected, logged, and responded to in a timely manner. By implementing continuous monitoring and strict access controls, we maintain the integrity and security of all network communications.

Effective network monitoring and defense are essential for **detecting threats, preventing unauthorized access, and enforcing network segmentation**. This policy provides the **framework for monitoring network traffic, implementing security policies, and responding to security events** within the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

---

## üî≠ **2. Scope**

This policy governs all aspects of network monitoring and defense across the lab environment, establishing clear requirements for traffic visibility, logging, and security controls. It applies to all systems and personnel involved in network operations.

This policy applies to **all network devices, monitoring tools, and access control policies** governing VLANs, network segmentation, and security event logging.

### **2.1 Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **network monitoring and defense** through multiple complementary mechanisms that work together to provide defense-in-depth:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Traffic Monitoring & Logging** | Wazuh and Loki used for network monitoring, depending on use case. |
| **VLAN Traffic Control** | VLAN-to-VLAN policies enforced for segmentation. |
| **Restricted Remote Access** | No remote access permitted to the internal lab network. |
| **Physical Network Security** | Network policies implemented on labswitch01 and labswitch02. |
| **Continuous Review** | Policies and configurations reviewed on a **monthly basis**. |

This integrated approach ensures that network security is maintained through continuous monitoring and structured defense mechanisms.

---

## üë• **3. Responsibilities**

Effective network monitoring requires clear role definition and accountability across the organization. Each role has specific responsibilities that contribute to our overall security posture.

The following table outlines the primary responsibilities for implementing and maintaining our network monitoring and defense controls:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Maintain network monitoring tools, enforce VLAN security policies, and manage segmentation controls. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Ensure logs are collected, monitor alerts for anomalies, and review security configurations. |
| **Users** | Follow access control policies and report any suspicious network behavior. |

This clear delineation of responsibilities ensures that network monitoring and defense remains a priority at all levels of the organization.

## üõ°Ô∏è **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Network Traffic Monitoring & Logging**

Continuous visibility into network traffic is essential for detecting and responding to security threats. Our monitoring strategy provides comprehensive coverage of all network communications.

The following table outlines our traffic monitoring and logging requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Traffic Analysis** | Wazuh and Loki deployed to monitor and log network events. |
| **Alerting & Detection** | Suspicious activity generates alerts for review. |
| **Log Retention** | Logs retained for **90 days** for forensic investigation. |

This monitoring infrastructure ensures that security events are promptly detected and investigated, reducing the potential impact of security incidents.

---

### **4.2 VLAN Segmentation & Access Control**

Network segmentation provides essential protection by limiting the potential impact of security breaches and enforcing the principle of least privilege.

The following table outlines our VLAN segmentation and access control requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **VLAN Segmentation** | VLAN-to-VLAN communication restricted based on security policies. |
| **Firewall Policy Enforcement** | Traffic filtering applied to enforce segmentation. |
| **Logging & Alerts** | All policy violations logged and reviewed. |

This segmentation approach contains potential security incidents and prevents lateral movement across the network.

---

### **4.3 Remote Access Security**

A fundamental principle of our network security is that internal resources should not be directly accessible from external networks. This Zero Trust approach significantly reduces our attack surface.

The following table outlines our remote access security requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Remote Access Restriction** | No external access to the lab network. |
| **Administrative Access** | Local access only via secure, segmented VLANs. |

These measures ensure that all access to internal resources follows secure authentication and access control processes.

---

### **4.4 Physical Network Security & Hardware Enforcement**

Security must be implemented at the physical network level to ensure comprehensive protection. Hardware controls provide an essential layer of defense.

The following table outlines our physical network security requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Physical Switch Security** | Network access policies enforced on labswitch01 and labswitch02. |
| **Unauthorized Device Detection** | Alerts generated for unapproved network devices. |

These physical controls ensure that network security extends to the hardware layer, preventing unauthorized device connections.

---

### **4.5 Policy Review & Continuous Improvement**

Network security requires ongoing review and improvement to address emerging threats and evolving requirements.

The following table outlines our approach to policy review and improvement:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Security Policy Review** | Network policies reviewed on a **monthly basis**. |
| **Log Analysis & Incident Response** | Logs analyzed for security trends and potential misconfigurations. |
| **Compliance Monitoring** | Regular audits ensure compliance with CIS benchmarks. |

This continuous improvement process ensures that network monitoring and defense mechanisms remain effective against evolving threats.

---

## üö´ **5. Exception Handling**

In certain scenarios, exceptions to this policy may be required. All exceptions must follow a structured review and approval process to ensure security risks are properly managed.

Exceptions to this policy must be **requested in writing** and include:

- **Justification for the request**
- **Risk assessment of non-compliance**
- **Proposed alternative mitigations**
- **Technical challenges preventing compliance**
- **Planned review date for reevaluation**

This structured approach ensures that any policy exceptions are properly documented and regularly reevaluated.

---

## üîí **6. Enforcement & Non-Compliance**

Enforcement mechanisms are essential for ensuring policy compliance. When violations are detected, a structured response process will be followed.

Failure to comply with this policy may result in:

- Restricted access to lab network resources
- Escalation to security teams for further investigation
- Remedial actions required to restore compliance

These enforcement measures ensure that policy violations are addressed promptly and appropriately.
