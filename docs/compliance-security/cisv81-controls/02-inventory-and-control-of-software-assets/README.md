# **ðŸ“¦ CIS Control 2: Inventory and Control of Software Assets in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**

## **1. Introduction**

Tracking installed software is **critical for security, compliance, and operational stability**. **CIS Control 2** mandates that organizations establish and maintain an **inventory of all software**, remove unauthorized applications, and **enforce execution policies** to reduce security risks.

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, this control is enforced using **Snipe-IT, Osquery, Ansible Playbooks, AppArmor, Group Policy, and automated ticketing (Zammad)**. This **fully automated and auditable software inventory system** ensures that only **authorized and supported software** is installed, while **unauthorized applications are detected and removed**.

## **2. Scope**

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | All software running on lab-managed **servers, workstations, VMs, and containers**. |
| **Out-of-Scope** | Temporary test environments and personal user applications. |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 2, NIST SP 800-53 (CM-8, SI-7), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.12.5.1). |

## **3. Sub-Control Implementation**

This section outlines **how each sub-control** of CIS Control 2 is enforced in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab.

### **2.1: Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory**

âœ… **Requirement:** Maintain a complete, regularly updated inventory of all software in the environment, including dependencies.

âœ… **Implementation in the Lab:**

- **Snipe-IT**: Tracks all **installed software as 'applications' and 'services'**.
- **Software dependencies** are mapped in **Snipe-IT** for transparency.
- **All software installations are tied to specific assets (VMs, servers, or workstations).**

---

### **2.2: Ensure Authorized Software is Currently Supported**

âœ… **Requirement:** Ensure that only **vendor-supported** and **actively maintained** software is used.

âœ… **Implementation in the Lab:**

- **Recurring Ticket in Zammad (Support Desk)**:
  - **Monthly task** to review software inventory and ensure **all software is vendor-supported**.
  - If unsupported software is found, **decommission or replace it**.
- **Automated Ansible Playbooks track unsupported software** (e.g., outdated packages, end-of-life (EOL) versions).

---

### **2.3: Address Unauthorized Software**

âœ… **Requirement:** Detect and remove any **unauthorized** software from systems.

âœ… **Implementation in the Lab:**

- **Osquery runs on all systems**, continuously scanning for **installed software**.
- **Monthly software inventory reviews** verify compliance.
- **Ansible Playbooks automate the process**:
  - **Automated scans** detect unauthorized software.
  - **API integration with Zammad** creates tickets for manual review.
  - **Non-approved software is automatically removed** where applicable.
- **Third-party software is installed via Winget**, ensuring software is from **trusted sources**.

---

### **2.4: Utilize Automated Software Inventory Tools**

âœ… **Requirement:** Use **automated tools** to inventory software across all managed systems.

âœ… **Implementation in the Lab:**

- **Osquery is deployed to all managed systems** to **inventory installed software**.
- **Winget manages third-party software installations**, ensuring proper documentation.
- **Software installations are logged**, allowing full traceability.

---

### **2.5, 2.6, and 2.7: Enforce Execution Restrictions on Unauthorized Software**

âœ… **Requirement:** Restrict **unauthorized software execution**, enforce **application control policies**, and monitor application usage.

âœ… **Implementation in the Lab:**

- **Windows (Group Policy)**:  
  - Software execution rules restrict **non-authorized applications**.
- **Linux (AppArmor)**:  
  - Controls which applications can execute and what **resources they can access**.
- **Logging & Alerting**:  
  - Unauthorized execution attempts trigger alerts via:
    - **Osquery** (real-time detection).
    - **Alertmanager** (alerts on violations).
    - **Wazuh SIEM** (correlates software usage logs for security monitoring).
