## **üõ†Ô∏è Schema Implementation Framework**

This section documents the database schema implementation architecture and design patterns for astronomical computing.

## **4.1 Astronomical Schema Architecture**

This subsection documents specialized schema design for astronomical data processing and scientific computing workloads supporting DESI DR1 analysis.

Astronomical schema architecture provides systematic organization of scientific catalogs through normalized design patterns, optimized data type selection, and specialized indexing strategies enabling efficient processing of large astronomical datasets. Schema design emphasizes catalog cross-matching performance, spatial query optimization, and scientific data integrity for enterprise astronomical computing infrastructure.

Schema implementation includes FastSpecFit catalog organization with optimized table structures for galaxy properties, stellar masses, star formation rates, and spectroscopic measurements. DESIVAST void catalog integration provides systematic void definition management with source tracking, spatial organization, and cross-reference capabilities supporting environmental analysis and scientific research requirements.

```sql
-- Example: Core astronomical schema structure
CREATE SCHEMA desi_analysis;

-- FastSpecFit galaxy catalog with optimized data types
CREATE TABLE desi_analysis.fastspecfit_iron (
    targetid BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    ra DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    dec DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    z DOUBLE PRECISION,
    logmstar REAL,
    sfr REAL,
    vdisp REAL,
    age REAL,
    av REAL,
    dn4000 REAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Void catalog with controlled vocabulary
CREATE TABLE desi_analysis.desivast_voids (
    void_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    void_catalog_source TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (void_catalog_source IN ('VoidFinder', 'V2_REVOLVER', 'V2_VIDE')),
    ra_center DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    dec_center DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    radius REAL NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Normalized galaxy-void mapping
CREATE TABLE desi_analysis.void_galaxy_map (
    targetid BIGINT REFERENCES desi_analysis.fastspecfit_iron(targetid),
    void_id INTEGER REFERENCES desi_analysis.desivast_voids(void_id),
    PRIMARY KEY (targetid, void_id)
);
```

## **4.2 Performance Optimization and Indexing**

This subsection documents specialized indexing strategies and query optimization for astronomical data processing and large-scale scientific computing.

Performance optimization and indexing provide systematic approaches for astronomical query acceleration through spatial indexing, B-tree optimization, and scientific workload patterns enabling efficient processing of million-row astronomical catalogs. Optimization implementation emphasizes coordinate-based queries, catalog cross-matching, and statistical analysis performance supporting enterprise astronomical computing requirements.

Indexing strategies include spatial indexing with Q3C or PostGIS extensions for coordinate-based queries, B-tree indexing for catalog identifiers and scientific parameters, composite indexing for multi-column queries, and partial indexing for filtered scientific analysis supporting optimal query performance across astronomical workloads and research operations.

```sql
-- Spatial indexing for astronomical coordinates (Q3C extension)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS q3c;
CREATE INDEX idx_fastspecfit_q3c ON desi_analysis.fastspecfit_iron 
    USING btree (q3c_ang2ipix(ra, dec));

-- B-tree indexes for scientific parameters
CREATE INDEX idx_fastspecfit_z ON desi_analysis.fastspecfit_iron (z);
CREATE INDEX idx_fastspecfit_logmstar ON desi_analysis.fastspecfit_iron (logmstar);
CREATE INDEX idx_void_source ON desi_analysis.desivast_voids (void_catalog_source);

-- Composite index for environmental analysis
CREATE INDEX idx_void_map_composite ON desi_analysis.void_galaxy_map (void_id, targetid);
```

## **4.3 Schema Management and Data Integrity**

This subsection documents systematic schema management procedures, migration strategies, and data integrity validation for astronomical database operations.

Schema management and data integrity provide systematic approaches for database schema evolution, version control, migration procedures, and validation ensuring reliable schema management across astronomical computing infrastructure. Management implementation includes schema versioning, migration scripting, constraint validation, and systematic testing supporting enterprise database operations and scientific data integrity.

Data integrity procedures include foreign key constraint validation, scientific parameter range checking, coordinate system validation, catalog consistency verification, and systematic data quality assessment ensuring reliable astronomical data processing and scientific analysis accuracy across enterprise database infrastructure supporting research operations.

All backup data encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption with keys managed through centralized key management system.

## **6.2 Recovery Procedures**

This subsection provides recovery processes for different failure scenarios across the hybrid infrastructure.

**Tiered Recovery Strategy:** Recovery procedures are organized by scope and urgency, from individual service restoration to full infrastructure rebuild. All recovery operations are documented with step-by-step procedures and tested quarterly during scheduled maintenance windows.
