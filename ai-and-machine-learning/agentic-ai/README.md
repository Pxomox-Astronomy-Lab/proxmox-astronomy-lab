# ü§ñ **Agentic AI**

Autonomous AI agent systems and intelligent automation infrastructure for research workflows, infrastructure management, and decision support across astronomical computing environments. This directory provides agentic AI implementations supporting autonomous operations, intelligent decision-making, and systematic automation across the Proxmox Astronomy Lab ecosystem.

## **Overview**

The Agentic AI directory encompasses comprehensive autonomous AI agent technologies designed to provide intelligent automation, decision support, and autonomous operations across astronomical research and enterprise infrastructure management. This implementation enables sophisticated autonomous agents, intelligent workflow automation, adaptive decision-making systems, and systematic automation capabilities supporting both research applications and infrastructure coordination through advanced AI agent architectures.

This directory establishes the foundation for autonomous AI operations that can understand context, make informed decisions, and execute complex workflows independently while maintaining oversight, transparency, and integration with existing systems across the astronomy research platform ecosystem.
