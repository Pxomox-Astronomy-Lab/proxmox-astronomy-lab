- **Testing Protocol**: Controlled implementation through test infrastructure with authentication validation
- **Monitoring Integration**: Local account authentication security event logging with access control validation
- **Documentation Standard**: Complete configuration mapping with CIS control references and authentication security validation

# üõ†Ô∏è **4. Implementation & Usage**

This section provides systematic guidance for implementing Local Account policy configuration and establishing local account security across domain infrastructure.

## **4.1 Prerequisites**

This subsection identifies requirements for successful Local Account policy implementation within domain infrastructure.

Local Account policy implementation requires enterprise domain infrastructure with appropriate administrative access and comprehensive local account security management capabilities:

- **Domain Infrastructure**: Windows Server 2025 domain-joined systems with Group Policy application capability
- **Administrative Access**: Domain Admin or equivalent Group Policy management permissions for local account security policy configuration
- **Authentication Infrastructure**: Established local account management and authentication validation capabilities

- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Security event monitoring capabilities for local account authentication tracking and policy compliance validation

## **4.2 Monitoring**

This subsection establishes monitoring requirements for Local Account policy effectiveness and local account security validation across domain infrastructure.

Local Account monitoring leverages the centralized monitoring stack on proj-mon01 (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, AlertManager, Grafana Alloy) for systematic local account security tracking and authentication bypass detection. The monitoring philosophy of "if it can be collected, we do" applies to local account authentication attempts, forced Guest access events, and authentication security through centralized security monitoring infrastructure.

Monitoring includes local account authentication correlation, sharing model validation, and access control security validation through comprehensive domain security monitoring and automated alerting for authentication bypass attempts or local account security violations.

# üîê **5. Security & Compliance**

This section establishes security framework alignment and compliance requirements for Local Account policy configuration within enterprise local account security architecture.

## **5.1 Security Framework Alignment**

This subsection maps Local Account policy configuration to enterprise security frameworks and compliance requirements for systematic local account security.

**Security Disclaimer**: The Local Account policy configuration documented in this guide represents a local account security baseline establishment for Windows Server 2025 domain infrastructure. These configurations should be thoroughly tested in non-production environments before deployment. While these templates follow CIS Controls v8 access control framework guidelines, organizations should validate policy compatibility with their specific local account requirements and authentication needs. The security research computing team maintains these configurations as implementation guidance rather than production security recommendations, and encourages consultation with dedicated security professionals for enterprise deployment validation.
