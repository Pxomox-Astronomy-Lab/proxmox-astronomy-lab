# 🤖 **Automation and Orchestration Infrastructure**

Enterprise automation, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and orchestration platforms enabling automated deployment, configuration management, and operational automation of the Proxmox Astronomy Lab's hybrid infrastructure. This directory encompasses GitOps workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and automated infrastructure management supporting astronomical research computing at scale.

## **Overview**

Automation and orchestration infrastructure provides the foundational layer enabling scalable, reproducible, and reliable management of our hybrid computing environment. Our enterprise-grade automation solutions support Infrastructure as Code principles, ensuring consistent deployment and configuration across VM-based services and Kubernetes workloads while maintaining operational excellence for astronomical research computing.

The automation architecture integrates declarative configuration management with event-driven orchestration, providing comprehensive automation capabilities from initial infrastructure provisioning through ongoing operational management. This approach ensures operational efficiency while maintaining the reliability and consistency required for production scientific computing environments.
