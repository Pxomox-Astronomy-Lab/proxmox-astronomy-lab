# **üîç Architecting a Secure, Compliance-Driven Hybrid Research Lab**

## **1. Introduction**

Citizen science is often viewed as an **open, collaborative, but loosely governed field**‚Äîtypically lacking the rigor of corporate IT environments. The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, however, takes a different approach: a research-driven citizen science project built on **enterprise-grade IT security and compliance principles**.

This document outlines the **secure architecture of the lab**, covering:

- **Hybrid identity and centralized authentication.**
- **External user access via controlled VDI environments.**
- **Structured enforcement of security policies using Entra, Azure Arc, and other tools.**
- **How this model satisfies compliance frameworks like CISv8, NIST, and ISO 27001.**

## **2. Key Principles of the Lab‚Äôs Secure Architecture**

The lab follows a **Zero Trust approach**, enforcing:
‚úÖ **Centralized identity & access management (IAM).**  
‚úÖ **Strictly controlled external access.**  
‚úÖ **Fully segmented, auditable research environments.**  
‚úÖ **Data protection measures preventing unauthorized exfiltration.**  

Each component of the **hybrid research model** has been designed to balance **accessibility, usability, and security**.

## **3. Hybrid Identity: Centralized Authentication & Access**

| **Component** | **Implementation** | **Security/Compliance Benefit** |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Windows Servers & VMs** | **All on-prem Windows 2025 servers and VMs are Entra Hybrid Joined.** | ‚úÖ **Centrally managed authentication & policy enforcement (CIS 5, 6).** |
| **Linux Servers** | **Joined to AD, SSO enforced via group-based sudo policies (e.g., `SG_Linux_sudoers`).** | ‚úÖ **Ensures Linux systems adhere to the same IAM standards as Windows.** |
| **Seamless SSO** | **Users authenticate once and access all approved resources based on identity.** | ‚úÖ **Eliminates shared credentials and enforces strict RBAC (CIS 5, 6).** |

This **unified identity model** ensures **all authentication is managed centrally**, reducing attack surfaces and enforcing **strong, policy-driven security**.

## **4. External User Access: Controlled Research Environments**

External users **never get raw access to the lab environment**. Instead, access is **fully contained** via:

### **üîπ Secure Research VDIs**

| **Workspace** | **Purpose** | **Security Model** |
|--------------|------------|--------------------|
| **RDS01 (Server 2025 RDS)** | Admin/Engineer VDI w/Office 2024 Plus, **RDP via Entra Private Access (EPA).** | ‚úÖ **Full Entra security applies (MFA, CA, risk detection, logging).** |
| **Kasm Workspaces** | **Ephemeral desktops with persistent home directories, streamed over EPA.** | ‚úÖ **No direct access to the lab‚Äîonly controlled, logged workspaces.** |
| **NFS Home Directories & Research Data** | **Mapped into Kasm workspaces for controlled access.** | ‚úÖ **Prevents direct data manipulation, ensuring full traceability.** |

### **üîπ Why This Model Works**

‚úÖ **No direct access to the network.** External users interact **only through RDP or Kasm Workspaces**.  
‚úÖ **Kasm ensures strict data controls** (e.g., copy/paste restrictions, app sandboxing).  
‚úÖ **All sessions are fully logged**‚Äîviolations can trigger automated security actions.  

This approach **replicates the security posture of corporate remote access environments**, applying **least privilege principles** to external collaborators.

## **5. Data Security: Preventing Unauthorized Access & Exfiltration**

| **Component** | **Implementation** | **Security/Compliance Benefit** |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| **SMB Shares via Azure Arc** | **SMB shares are served from a Windows Server managed via Azure Arc.** | ‚úÖ **Qualifies for Azure security policies, including DLP (CIS 13, 15).** |
| **Kasm-Based File Access** | **Users interact with files only within controlled Kasm sessions.** | ‚úÖ **Prevents unauthorized exfiltration (CIS 15 ‚Äì Data Exfiltration).** |
| **Windows & Linux File Access Controls** | **File permissions enforced via AD and Linux group policies.** | ‚úÖ **Ensures granular access control (CIS 6 ‚Äì Access Management).** |

If **Azure DLP applies to Arc-managed SMB shares**, this **further strengthens data protection**, allowing **policy-driven restrictions** on **file access, transfer, and sharing**.

## **6. Compliance Impact: How This Model Satisfies CISv8**

This model satisfies **dozens of CISv8 controls** **without excessive complexity**.

| **CIS Control** | **How This Architecture Satisfies It** |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **CIS 1 ‚Äì Inventory & Asset Control** | **Hybrid-joined systems & tracked assets (Snipe-IT, Netbox, Intune).** |
| **CIS 3 ‚Äì Data Protection** | **Logged access, controlled workspaces, SMB share security.** |
| **CIS 5 ‚Äì Account Management** | **Entra Hybrid Join, AD-based access control, PIM potential.** |
| **CIS 6 ‚Äì Access Control** | **MFA, CA policies, restricted network segmentation.** |
| **CIS 12 ‚Äì Network Monitoring** | **EPA logs all external access, Alertmanager + Wazuh for detection.** |
| **CIS 13 ‚Äì Data Security** | **Azure DLP (if applicable), Kasm workspace restrictions.** |
| **CIS 15 ‚Äì Data Exfiltration** | **No direct access, logs monitor & prevent unauthorized actions.** |

## **7. Summary: A Blueprint for Secure, Compliant Research**

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** is **one of the most security-focused citizen science projects in existence**. The architecture:
‚úÖ **Maintains a secure, hybrid identity model.**  
‚úÖ **Restricts external access to fully controlled, logged research workspaces.**  
‚úÖ **Implements enterprise-grade security practices, enforceable via CISv8 and Azure policies.**  
‚úÖ **Serves as a repeatable model for future research labs.**

This approach **proves that high-level IT security is not limited to corporations**‚Äîit can be applied **even in the realm of citizen science and research collaborations**. üöÄ
