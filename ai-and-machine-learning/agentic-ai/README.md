# ðŸ¤– **Agentic AI**

Autonomous AI systems and intelligent agents for automated astronomical research workflows, infrastructure management, and intelligent task orchestration across the Proxmox Astronomy Lab.

## **Overview**

This directory contains agentic AI implementations that provide autonomous decision-making and task execution capabilities across our astronomical computing infrastructure. These systems enable intelligent automation of research workflows, infrastructure monitoring, and operational tasks while maintaining human oversight and control.

**Primary Focus**: Autonomous agents that can reason about astronomical data, manage infrastructure operations, and coordinate complex research workflows with minimal human intervention while ensuring scientific rigor and operational safety.

## **Current Implementation**

### **Research Automation Agents**

- **Data Pipeline Orchestration**: Intelligent management of DESI data processing workflows
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation and error detection in astronomical datasets
- **Research Task Coordination**: Multi-step research workflow execution and monitoring
- **Result Validation**: Intelligent verification of analysis outputs and scientific consistency

### **Infrastructure Management Agents**

- **System Monitoring**: Proactive identification and resolution of infrastructure issues
- **Resource Optimization**: Dynamic allocation and scaling of computing resources
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Intelligent planning of system updates and maintenance windows
- **Performance Analysis**: Continuous optimization of cluster performance and efficiency

## **Key Features**

- **Autonomous Decision Making**: AI agents capable of reasoning about complex scenarios
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Collaborative agent systems for complex task execution
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Seamless integration of human oversight with autonomous operations
- **Scientific Rigor**: Agents designed with understanding of astronomical research requirements

## **Agent Types**

### **Research Agents**

- **Data Quality Agent**: Continuous monitoring and validation of astronomical datasets
- **Pipeline Orchestrator**: Coordination of multi-step data processing workflows
- **Analysis Validator**: Verification of scientific analysis results and methodology

### **Operations Agents**
