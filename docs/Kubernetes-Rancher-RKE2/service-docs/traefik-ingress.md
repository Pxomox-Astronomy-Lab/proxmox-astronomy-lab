  - Middleware for request/response transformations
  - TLSStore for certificate configuration

- **Service Integration**: Multiple service discovery mechanisms
  - Kubernetes Ingress resources (backward compatibility)
  - Kubernetes CRD resources (advanced functionality)
  - Service integration for direct routing

- **Middleware Stack**: Pre-configured middleware for common scenarios
  - Security headers for all responses
  - Rate limiting for abuse prevention
  - IP filtering for restricted endpoints

- **TLS Configuration**: Secure HTTPS access
  - Integration with cert-manager for automated certificate management
  - TLS 1.2+ with modern cipher suites
  - Automated certificate renewal

This architecture provides a robust, secure gateway for external access to Kubernetes services while maintaining high availability and observability.
