# 🔍 **Problem Management**

# 🔍 **1. Overview**

Problem Management in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab focuses on the systematic identification, analysis, and resolution of underlying causes of incidents to prevent their recurrence and minimize their impact. Unlike Incident Management, which addresses immediate service restoration, Problem Management takes a proactive approach to eliminate root causes of recurring issues and implement permanent solutions that improve overall service stability and reliability.

This section documents our Problem Management framework, methodologies for root cause analysis, knowledge base integration, and proactive problem identification to drive continuous service improvement throughout our infrastructure and research environments.
