# 🚨 **Incident Management**

# 🔍 **1. Overview**

The Incident Management process within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab provides a structured approach to handling unplanned interruptions and degradations of IT services. This process ensures that normal service operation is restored as quickly as possible with minimal impact to research activities, infrastructure stability, and user productivity. Our incident management framework follows ITIL best practices while being tailored to our lab environment's specific needs and scale.

This section documents our incident lifecycle, categorization approach, escalation paths, and response procedures to ensure consistent and effective handling of all service disruptions.

# 🔄 **2. Incident Lifecycle**

## **2.1 Incident Process Flow**

The standardized workflow for managing incidents from detection to closure:

| **Stage** | **Key Activities** | **Responsible Roles** | **Documentation** |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Detection** | Identification via monitoring or reporting | Monitoring systems, Users, Operations | [Incident Detection](Detection-Tools/detection-methods.md) |
| **Logging** | Initial documentation and categorization | Tier 1 Support, Service Desk | [Incident Logging](Incident-Procedures/incident-logging.md) |
| **Classification** | Priority and impact assessment | Incident Manager | [Classification Guidelines](Severity-Definitions/classification-matrix.md) |
| **Investigation** | Diagnosis and root cause analysis | Technical Support Teams | [Investigation Process](Response-Procedures/investigation-process.md) |
| **Resolution** | Implementation of fix or workaround | Technical Support Teams | [Resolution Guidelines](Response-Procedures/resolution-guidelines.md) |
| **Closure** | Verification and documentation finalization | Incident Manager, User | [Incident Closure](Incident-Procedures/incident-closure.md) |

## **2.2 Incident Categories**

Classification of incidents by affected service area:

| **Category** | **Scope** | **Examples** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Infrastructure** | Physical/virtual hardware, network | Host failure, network outage | [Infrastructure Incidents](Incident-Types/infrastructure-incidents.md) |
| **Application** | Software and services | Database unavailability, application error | [Application Incidents](Incident-Types/application-incidents.md) |
| **Security** | Security-related events | Unauthorized access, malware | [Security Incidents](Incident-Types/security-incidents.md) |
| **Observatory** | Scientific equipment | SDR failure, feed issues | [Observatory Incidents](Incident-Types/observatory-incidents.md) |

# 🔥 **3. Severity and Prioritization**

## **3.1 Severity Levels**

Standardized impact levels for incident classification:

| **Severity** | **Definition** | **Response Target** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Critical (S1)** | Complete service outage, broad impact | Immediate response, 4hr resolution | [Critical Severity](Severity-Definitions/critical-severity.md) |
| **High (S2)** | Significant degradation, major function affected | 30min response, 8hr resolution | [High Severity](Severity-Definitions/high-severity.md) |
| **Medium (S3)** | Limited impact, workaround available | 4hr response, 24hr resolution | [Medium Severity](Severity-Definitions/medium-severity.md) |
| **Low (S4)** | Minimal impact, cosmetic issues | 24hr response, 72hr resolution | [Low Severity](Severity-Definitions/low-severity.md) |

## **3.2 Priority Assignment**

Matrix for determining incident priority based on urgency and impact:

| **Urgency/Impact** | **High Impact** | **Medium Impact** | **Low Impact** |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **High Urgency** | Critical (S1) | High (S2) | Medium (S3) |
| **Medium Urgency** | High (S2) | Medium (S3) | Low (S4) |
| **Low Urgency** | Medium (S3) | Low (S4) | Low (S4) |

The priority matrix helps ensure appropriate resource allocation based on the combined factors of urgency and impact.
