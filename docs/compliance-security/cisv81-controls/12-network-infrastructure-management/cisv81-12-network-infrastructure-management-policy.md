# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-12 Network Infrastructure Management Policy**

## **1. Overview**

### **Why This Policy Matters**

Securing network infrastructure is critical for **preventing unauthorized access, maintaining operational integrity, and enforcing Zero Trust architecture** within the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**. This policy ensures that **all network devices, configurations, and access controls** are managed securely and consistently.

### **Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **secure network management** through:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Firmware & Configuration Management** | Monthly firmware reviews for switches and firewalls. |
| **Edge Security** | FortiGate firewall as the edge router; no DNAT to the lab. |
| **Zero Trust & Access Controls** | External access restricted via Entra Private Access (EPA) and MFA. |
| **Change Management & Versioning** | All network configuration changes are stored in Git for version control. |
| **Centralized Monitoring & Logging** | Network activity logged and analyzed using Loki, Prometheus, and Alert Manager. |
| **Traffic Security** | No insecure network services or protocols, all legacy services disabled. |
| **Internal Segmentation & Access Control** | Jump boxes secured with EPA, MFA, and Just-In-Time (JIT) access. |

This policy aligns with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**, ensuring a structured, automated, and auditable network management approach.

## **2. Compliance Mapping**

This policy aligns with **industry security frameworks** to maintain best practices:

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 12 â€“ Network Infrastructure Management |
| **NIST 800-53** | SC-7 â€“ Boundary Protection |
| **ISO 27001** | A.13.1 â€“ Network Security Controls |

---

## **3. Responsibilities**

Roles and responsibilities ensure **proper enforcement of network security policies**:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Maintain network devices, enforce Zero Trust, and monitor traffic logs. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Apply firewall rules, manage jump box access, and enforce secure configurations. |
| **Users** | Follow network access policies and report any unauthorized access attempts. |

---

## **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Firmware & Configuration Management**

Regular firmware updates reduce vulnerabilities and maintain system stability:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Monthly Firmware Reviews** | All switches and firewalls reviewed for updates. |
| **Configuration Version Control** | All network config changes tracked via Git. |
| **Change Approval Process** | Major changes require IT review before deployment. |

---

### **4.2 Edge Security & Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)**

A secure perimeter ensures **no direct inbound access** to internal lab assets:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **No DNAT to Lab** | No direct inbound traffic allowed to lab systems. |
| **Secure External Access** | Enforced via Entra Private Access (EPA) & MFA. |
| **Legacy Services Disabled** | No Telnet, SMBv1, or other insecure protocols allowed. |

---

### **4.3 Traffic & Protocol Security**

All internal and external network traffic must be **secured and logged**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Secure Internal Traffic** | No unsecured services, all legacy protocols disabled. |
| **DNS Security** | DNS traffic filtered through **Technitium DNS** servers. |
| **Full Network Encryption** | TLS, SSH, and encrypted VPN tunnels enforced. |

---

### **4.4 Network Logging & Monitoring**

Comprehensive network visibility is **essential for security and compliance**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Centralized Logging** | FortiGate logs sent to Loki for analysis. |
| **Network Anomaly Detection** | Prometheus & Alert Manager monitor network events. |
| **Hybrid Active Directory Logging** | All authentication logs aggregated for review. |

---

### **4.5 Jump Box & Privileged Access Security**

Secure internal access to sensitive infrastructure via **restricted jump boxes**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Jump Box Access** | Only accessible via EPA, MFA, and JIT approval. |
| **Role-Based Authentication** | Enforced via Entra ID and AD security policies. |
| **Session Logging & Review** | All administrative access sessions logged and reviewed. |

---

### **4.6 Network Segmentation & Least Privilege**

Strict access controls limit network exposure and **enforce least privilege**:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Firewall Segmentation** | Enforced via FortiGate policies. |
| **No Open Ports** | All unused network ports disabled at the switch level. |
| **Internal System Segmentation** | Critical systems isolated from general user networks. |
