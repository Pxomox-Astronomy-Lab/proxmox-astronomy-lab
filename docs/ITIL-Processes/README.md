# 🔄 **ITIL Processes**

## 🔍 **1. Overview**

The Proxmox Astronomy Lab implements a **unique role-based simulation approach** to IT Service Management (ITSM) that allows a **single operator to experience and practice ITIL processes** in a realistic environment. This approach embraces ITIL's structured framework by systematically rotating through defined roles to build a comprehensive service management practice.

This simulation provides both **practical ITSM experience** and a **structured framework** for managing the lab's infrastructure and services while aligning with industry best practices.

### **1.1 Core Concept**

The simulation is built on a simple but powerful premise: **a single person can experience the full ITIL framework** by methodically assuming different roles within structured processes. This approach:

| **Benefit** | **Implementation** |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Enterprise ITSM Experience** | Following formal processes that mirror enterprise environments |
| **Multi-perspective Documentation** | Creating documentation from various service perspectives |
| **Skill Development** | Building transferable skills applicable to larger organizations |
| **Quality Management** | Ensuring consistent, high-quality infrastructure management |
| **Structure & Governance** | Preventing the "lone admin" syndrome common in home labs |

## 🏢 **2. Simulation Roles & Structure**

### **2.1 Primary Roles**

The lab implements a hybrid model where each simulation role encompasses several related ITIL functions:

| **Simulation Role** | **Encompasses ITIL Functions** | **Primary Responsibilities** |
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Lab Owner** | IT Steering, Service Portfolio, Financial Management | Strategic direction, portfolio decisions, budgeting, prioritization |
| **Engineer** | Enterprise Architecture, Technical Analysis, Infrastructure | Infrastructure design, service architecture, technical implementation |
| **Operations** | IT Operations, Problem, Service Level Management | Day-to-day operations, monitoring, stability, incident response |
| **Security Administrator** | Information Security, Access, Compliance Management | Security controls, compliance verification, risk management |
| **Service Desk** | 1st Level Support, Service Requests, Knowledge Management | User support, service requests, knowledge articles |
| **Change Management** | Change Manager, CAB, Release Management | Change control, release coordination, configuration management |
| **Continuous Improvement** | CSI, Process Ownership, Service Ownership | Service improvements, process refinement, service ownership |

### **2.2 Role Rotation Methodology**

Role rotation follows a structured approach:

| **Rotation Method** | **Implementation** | **Documentation** |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Process-Based** | Different roles engage based on the ITIL process | [Process Engagement Model](change-management/role-responsibilities.md) |
| **Service Lifecycle** | Rotations follow ITIL service lifecycle stages | [Service Lifecycle Model](service-catalog/lifecycle-stages.md) |
| **Issue-Based** | Specific issues trigger appropriate role involvement | [Incident Escalation Matrix](incident-management/escalation-matrix.md) |
| **Temporal** | Dedicated time periods for specific roles | [Role Rotation Schedule](role-rotation-schedule.md) |

---

## 🛠️ **3. ITSM Tool Implementation**

### **3.1 GLPI Platform**

The lab uses **GLPI (Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique)** as the core platform to support ITIL processes:

| **GLPI Module** | **ITIL Process Support** | **Primary Role Usage** |
|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Assets Management** | Service Asset & Configuration Management | Engineer, Operations |
| **CMDB & Relationships** | Configuration Management | Change Management, Engineer |
| **Change Management** | Change Control, Release Management | Change Management, All Roles |
| **Service Desk** | Incident Management, Request Fulfillment | Service Desk, Operations |
| **Problem Management** | Problem Control, Known Error Database | Operations, Engineer |
| **Knowledge Base** | Knowledge Management | Service Desk, All Roles |
| **SLA Management** | Service Level Management | Operations, Service Desk |

### **3.2 GLPI Simulation Configuration**

GLPI has been configured for the single-operator simulation through:

- **Role-specific user accounts** with appropriate permissions
- **Custom workflows** that enforce ITIL processes
- **Automation rules** that simulate interactions between roles
- **Notification templates** for process communication
- **Dashboard customization** for role-specific views
