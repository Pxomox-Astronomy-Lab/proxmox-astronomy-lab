# 🤖 **AI/ML Infrastructure**

The AI/ML infrastructure directory encompasses artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab platform. This category covers GPU acceleration, distributed computing frameworks, ML model deployment, and specialized astronomical AI workflows that enable cutting-edge research on the 7-node cluster while adhering to responsible AI development practices.

## **Overview**

The AI/ML infrastructure represents a critical component of our enterprise-grade astronomical computing platform, enabling sophisticated machine learning workflows on large astronomical datasets. Built around RTX A4000 GPU acceleration and distributed Ray computing clusters, this infrastructure supports production ML workloads including the 1.6M spectra anomalous quasar detection project and advanced astronomical data analysis.

Our AI/ML capabilities bridge traditional astronomical computing with modern machine learning methodologies, following **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)** guidelines for trustworthy and responsible AI development. The platform emphasizes **Explainable AI (XAI)** principles, ensuring that astronomical ML models provide interpretable results essential for scientific validation and peer review. This approach enables researchers to understand model decision-making processes, validate astronomical discoveries, and maintain scientific rigor in AI-driven research.

The infrastructure integrates seamlessly with our hybrid Kubernetes/VM architecture, allowing for flexible deployment patterns that optimize resource utilization while maintaining the performance requirements of computationally intensive ML workloads. All AI implementations prioritize transparency, accountability, and scientific reproducibility in accordance with NIST AI RMF governance principles.
