# üîß **04-Secure-Configuration-of-Enterprise-Assets-and-Software Directory**

Comprehensive security assurance directory for CIS Control 4 (Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software) implementation within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab enterprise environment. This directory contains systematic policy framework, Group Policy Object configurations, and evidence collection mechanisms that establish enterprise-grade security baseline through standardized configuration management, automated hardening enforcement, and continuous compliance validation across all enterprise assets and software systems.

## **Overview**

The CIS Control 4 directory provides complete implementation framework for establishing secure configuration management across enterprise infrastructure. This encompasses policy governance through enterprise security framework documentation, technical implementation through comprehensive Group Policy Object configurations for Windows Server 2025 infrastructure, and systematic evidence collection for compliance validation and security assurance reporting. The implementation follows defense-in-depth principles that provide systematic security hardening covering system configuration, application security, network infrastructure protection, and comprehensive compliance validation.

This secure configuration framework serves as a foundational security control that integrates with domain infrastructure, identity management systems, and security monitoring to provide comprehensive attack surface reduction and systematic security baseline enforcement. The implementation establishes enterprise-grade configuration security that supports both regulatory compliance requirements and operational security management while maintaining system functionality and administrative efficiency across the astronomical computing infrastructure.
