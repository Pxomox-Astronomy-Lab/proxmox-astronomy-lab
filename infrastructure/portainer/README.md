# 🎛️ **Portainer Container Management**

This directory contains configuration documentation and deployment procedures for Portainer enterprise container management within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. Portainer provides unified management interface across Docker hosts and RKE2 Kubernetes cluster utilizing enterprise licensing for enhanced features and multi-environment support.

## **Overview**

The Portainer configuration focuses on enterprise licensing deployment across our container infrastructure, providing centralized management capabilities for Docker microservices and Kubernetes workloads. Our implementation utilizes the free 3-node enterprise license enabling advanced features including RBAC, audit logging, and multi-environment management essential for research computing operations.

Portainer serves as the primary management interface for container operations, providing unified visibility and control across heterogeneous container environments while maintaining enterprise-grade security and operational capabilities required for astronomical computing workloads and research productivity.
