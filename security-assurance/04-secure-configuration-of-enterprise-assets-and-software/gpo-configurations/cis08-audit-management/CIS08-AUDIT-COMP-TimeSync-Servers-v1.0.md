# 📋 **1. Executive Summary**

This document provides comprehensive implementation guidance for the CIS08-AUDIT-COMP-TimeSync-Servers-v1.0 Group Policy Object (GPO), which implements CIS Microsoft Windows Server 2025 Benchmark recommendation 18.9.51.1.2 by disabling Windows Time Service (W32Time) NTP Server functionality on Member Servers within the radioastronomy.io enterprise environment. This GPO establishes secure time synchronization hierarchy by preventing unauthorized time service distribution while maintaining centralized domain time authority through Domain Controller coordination.

The policy addresses critical time infrastructure security requirements by disabling NTP Server capability on Member Servers, eliminating potential time service conflicts and unauthorized time distribution that could compromise audit log timestamp integrity. This implementation supports the enterprise's CIS Controls v8 baseline and enhances overall time synchronization security through systematic time authority centralization that ensures hierarchical domain time coordination, prevents time service confusion, and maintains chronological accuracy across audit infrastructure while eliminating unauthorized time sources that could undermine forensic timeline integrity.

- **Documentation Standard**: Complete time service security configuration with CIS control references and threat analysis

# 🛠️ **4. Implementation & Usage**

This section provides systematic guidance for implementing TimeSync Servers configuration and establishing secure time synchronization hierarchy across Member Server infrastructure.

## **4.1 Prerequisites**

This subsection identifies requirements for successful TimeSync Servers implementation within Member Server infrastructure.

TimeSync Servers implementation requires enterprise domain infrastructure with appropriate administrative access and comprehensive time synchronization security monitoring capabilities:

- **Domain Infrastructure**: Windows Server 2025 Member Server systems with Group Policy application capability
- **Administrative Access**: Domain Admin or equivalent Group Policy management permissions for Windows Time Service configuration

## **4.2 Monitoring**

This subsection establishes monitoring requirements for TimeSync Servers effectiveness and time synchronization security infrastructure management.

TimeSync Servers monitoring leverages the centralized monitoring stack on proj-mon01 (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, AlertManager, Grafana Alloy) for systematic time service security tracking and unauthorized time source detection. The monitoring philosophy of "if it can be collected, we do" applies to all time service metrics with specialized tracking for NTP server status, unauthorized time distribution detection, and time hierarchy integrity across Member Server infrastructure.

Monitoring includes time service security validation, NTP server disablement verification, and unauthorized time source alerting through comprehensive infrastructure monitoring and automated detection for time service violations and hierarchy breaches.

# 🔐 **5. Security & Compliance**

This section establishes security framework alignment and compliance requirements for TimeSync Servers configuration within enterprise time synchronization security infrastructure.

## **5.1 Security Framework Alignment**

This subsection maps TimeSync Servers configuration to enterprise security frameworks and compliance requirements for systematic time synchronization security management.

**Security Disclaimer**: The TimeSync Servers configuration documented in this guide represents a foundational time synchronization security baseline establishment for Windows Server 2025 Member Server systems. These configurations should be thoroughly tested in non-production environments before deployment. While these templates follow CIS Controls v8 audit log management framework guidelines, organizations should validate time service security compatibility with their specific operational requirements and time synchronization infrastructure. The security research computing team maintains these configurations as implementation guidance rather than production security recommendations, and encourages consultation with dedicated security professionals for enterprise deployment validation.
