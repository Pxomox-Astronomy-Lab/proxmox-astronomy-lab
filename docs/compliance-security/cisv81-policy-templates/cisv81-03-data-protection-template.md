# **ðŸ“œ CISv8 Data Protection Policy Template**

## **1. Overview**  

### **Why This Policy Matters**  

The **Data Protection Policy** ensures that **sensitive, confidential, and mission-critical data is properly managed, secured, and retained** throughout its lifecycle. Inadequate data protection **increases the risk of data breaches, compliance violations, and operational failures**.

Key aspects of this policy include:  

âœ… **Defining data classification and retention policies**.  
âœ… **Implementing access controls, encryption, and monitoring**.  
âœ… **Preventing unauthorized access, modification, or loss of sensitive data**.  
âœ… **Ensuring compliance with industry security frameworks**.  

This document **presents the CISv8 Data Protection Policy Template** and includes **additional information on how organizations may implement it**, along with a **generalized example of its application in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

| **Framework**      | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **CIS Controls**   | CIS Control 3 â€“ Data Protection |
| **NIST 800-53**    | SC-12 (Cryptographic Key Establishment), MP-6 (Media Sanitization) |
| **ISO 27001**      | A.8.2 (Information Classification), A.10.1 (Cryptographic Controls) |

## **3. CISv8 Data Protection Policy Template**  

```markdown
# Data Protection Policy Template  

## **Purpose**  
Managing data within an enterprise includes **data classification, inventory, handling, retention, and disposal**. The **Data Protection Policy** provides the processes and procedures for governing enterprise data, ensuring that:  
- **Data is classified based on sensitivity and regulatory requirements**.  
- **Access to sensitive data is properly managed and restricted**.  
- **Data is securely encrypted and protected from unauthorized access**.  
- **Retention policies are enforced, and expired data is securely disposed of**.  

---

## **Responsibility**  
- **IT is responsible** for implementing and enforcing data protection policies.  
- **Users are responsible** for following data handling and classification guidelines.  
- **Data Owners must ensure compliance with retention and security policies.**  

---

## **Policy**  

### **4.1 Data Classification & Inventory Management**  
1. **IT must conduct an annual data inventory** to track data storage locations, classification, and ownership.  
2. **Data must be classified into categories**:  
   - **Public** â€“ No risk if disclosed.  
   - **Internal** â€“ Limited risk (system logs, general research datasets).  
   - **Confidential** â€“ Higher risk (API keys, credentials, telemetry).  
   - **Restricted** â€“ Critical risk (password vaults, sensitive scientific data).  
3. **All newly created or obtained sensitive data must be tracked**.  

---

### **4.2 Data Protection & Access Control**  
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be enforced** to restrict data access.  
2. **Sensitive data must be encrypted** using:  
   - **AES-256 encryption for stored data**.  
   - **TLS 1.3 for data in transit**.  
   - **BitLocker and LUKS for disk encryption**.  
3. **Access permissions must be reviewed annually**.  
4. **Unauthorized data access attempts must trigger security alerts**.  

---

### **4.3 Data Retention & Handling**  
1. **A written data retention plan must be maintained** based on compliance requirements.  
2. **Retention periods must be clearly defined** based on data type.  
3. **Data that exceeds its retention period must be securely deleted**.  

#### **Retention Policy Example**  

| **Data Type** | **Retention Period** |
|--------------|------------------|
| Logs (SIEM, Wazuh) | 1 Year |
| Research Data | 5 Years |
| System Backups | 90 Days |
| Compliance Records | 7 Years |

---

### **4.4 Data Disposal & Secure Deletion**  
1. **Data that is no longer required must be securely destroyed**.  
2. **Sensitive data must be deleted in a way that prevents recovery**.  

#### **Approved Destruction Methods**  

| **Data Type** | **Destruction Method** |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Printed Documents | Cross-cut shredding |
| Portable Media (USB, SSD, DVD) | Physical destruction |
| HDDs & Magnetic Media | Overwriting (DoD 5220.22-M), degaussing |
| Cloud Storage | Vendor-specific permanent deletion |

3. **All destruction events must be logged**, and proof of destruction obtained if applicable.  

---

### **4.5 Logging & Monitoring of Sensitive Data**  
1. **All sensitive data access must be logged and stored**.  
2. **Unauthorized access attempts must trigger alerts**.  
3. **Audit logs must be retained for compliance tracking**.  

#### **Logging & Monitoring Example**  

| **System** | **Logging Method** | **Retention** |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| File Access Logs | Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring | 1 Year |
| Database Access | SQL Audit Logs | 1 Year |
| Network Traffic | Firewall Logs | 6 Months |
| Cloud Storage | Azure Logging | 1 Year |

```

## **4. Best Practices for Implementing This Policy**  

Organizations implementing **CIS Control 3 â€“ Data Protection** should consider:  

- **Automating data classification** â€“ Using **DLP (Data Loss Prevention) tools** or built-in cloud services to **automatically classify and label sensitive data**.  
- **Enforcing access controls with MFA** â€“ Ensuring **restricted data access is protected via RBAC and multi-factor authentication**.  
- **Implementing encryption by default** â€“ **Encrypting all sensitive data at rest and in transit** using **AES-256 and TLS 1.3**.  
- **Auditing access to sensitive data** â€“ **Maintaining logs of all access events for compliance and security monitoring**.  
- **Regularly reviewing and updating retention policies** â€“ Ensuring **data is not retained longer than necessary** for compliance.  

These best practices help **align an organizationâ€™s data protection strategy with CIS recommendations** while **mitigating security risks associated with data exposure**.

## **5. Example Implementation in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**  

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, **CIS Control 3** is implemented through the following methods:

### **5.1 Data Classification & Access Control**  

âœ… **All sensitive research data is tagged using metadata classification**.  
âœ… **Access to critical data is restricted via RBAC and enforced through Active Directory groups**.  
âœ… **Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all privileged data access**.  

### **5.2 Encryption & Secure Storage**  

âœ… **BitLocker and LUKS are used to encrypt stored data**.  
âœ… **Database records containing sensitive information are encrypted using AES-256**.  
âœ… **TLS 1.3 is enforced for all network traffic involving sensitive data**.  

### **5.3 Automated Retention & Disposal**  

âœ… **Data retention policies are enforced via automated lifecycle rules**.  
âœ… **Expired research data is securely deleted**.  
âœ… **Audit logs are stored securely and reviewed for compliance tracking**.

## **6. Summary and Next Steps**  

âœ… **This document presents the official CISv8 Data Protection Policy Template.**  
âœ… **It includes additional information on possible implementation strategies.**  
âœ… **A high-level example from the Proxmox Astronomy Lab is provided for reference.**  

ðŸ“Œ **Actionable Next Steps:**  

- **Ensure data classification and access control policies align with compliance standards**.  
- **Implement automation for data encryption, retention, and deletion**.
