# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-07 Continuous Vulnerability Management Policy**

## **1. Overview**

### **Why This Policy Matters**

Vulnerability management is the process of identifying, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities in enterprise systems. This policy establishes the **Proxmox Astronomy Labâ€™s** approach to continuous vulnerability management, ensuring that **all assets are monitored, assessed, and updated** to prevent security risks.

### **Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **continuous vulnerability management** through:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Automated Patch Management** | OS and application updates enforced via Ansible and package managers. |
| **Regular Vulnerability Assessments** | Wazuh and CIS-CAT Lite scans performed to detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. |
| **No Externally Exposed Assets** | No inbound ports; all external access restricted via Entra Private Access. |
| **Automated & Human Remediation** | Auto-remediation where possible; manual review for complex vulnerabilities. |
| **Staged Update Deployment** | Rolling reboots and staged patching to minimize downtime. |

This policy aligns with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**, ensuring a structured and auditable vulnerability management program.

---

## **2. Compliance Mapping**

This policy aligns with **industry security frameworks** to maintain best practices:

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 7 â€“ Continuous Vulnerability Management |
| **NIST 800-53** | RA-5 â€“ Vulnerability Monitoring & Remediation |
| **ISO 27001** | A.12.6 â€“ Technical Vulnerability Management |

---

## **3. Responsibilities**

Roles and responsibilities ensure **proper enforcement of vulnerability management**:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Enforce patching schedules, conduct vulnerability scans, and remediate security gaps. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Ensure automated updates are applied, review vulnerability reports, and implement required configurations. |
| **Users** | Follow update policies, apply updates where required, and report potential vulnerabilities. |

---

## **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Vulnerability Assessment & Monitoring**

A continuous vulnerability assessment process ensures that **all systems are scanned and analyzed** for security risks:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Automated Vulnerability Scanning** | Wazuh and CIS-CAT Lite perform scheduled scans. |
| **Patch & Update Tracking** | All systems must be configured to receive vendor security updates. |
| **Remediation Prioritization** | High-severity vulnerabilities are addressed first. |
| **Monthly Compliance Reports** | IT must generate a vulnerability status report. |

---

### **4.2 Patch & Update Management**

Patch management ensures that **all operating systems and applications remain updated**:

| **System** | **Update Method** | **Frequency** |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Windows** | Ansible via PowerShell Update Module | Weekly |
| **Linux** | Ansible via apt-get, Unattended Updates | Weekly |
| **Third-Party Apps (Windows)** | Win-Get Auto-Update | Weekly |
| **Security Updates (All OS)** | Pre-staged for rolling deployment | Weekly |

All updates are staged to prevent downtime and system disruption.

---

### **4.3 No External Exposure & Access Controls**

All **external access is strictly controlled**, with no inbound access allowed:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **No Externally Exposed Assets** | No inbound ports are open to the lab network. |
| **Remote Access Restrictions** | Entra Private Access required for external connections. |
| **Zero-Trust Network Architecture** | Enforced through conditional access policies. |

---

### **4.4 Vulnerability Prioritization & Remediation**

Identified vulnerabilities must be **prioritized and remediated** based on severity:

| **Severity Level** | **Remediation Timeline** |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Critical (CVE 9.0-10.0)** | Addressed immediately with emergency patching. |
| **High (CVE 7.0-8.9)** | Addressed within 5 days. |
| **Medium (CVE 4.0-6.9)** | Addressed within 30 days. |
| **Low (CVE 1.0-3.9)** | Reviewed and remediated as needed. |

---

### **4.5 Auto-Remediation & Manual Review**

Simple vulnerabilities are **auto-remediated where possible**, with manual review for complex issues:

| **Vulnerability Type** | **Remediation Method** |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Missing Patches** | Auto-updated via Ansible scripts. |
| **Misconfigurations** | Auto-remediated via CIS-CAT recommendations. |
| **Privileged Access Violations** | Flagged for manual review and remediation. |
| **Anomalous Network Behavior** | Logged and escalated for security review. |

---

### **4.6 Logging & Reporting**

All **vulnerability-related activity is logged and reviewed**:

| **Monitoring Tool** | **Function** |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Wazuh SIEM** | Logs security events and vulnerability alerts. |
| **CIS-CAT Lite** | Generates compliance scans and hardening recommendations. |
| **Ansible Reports** | Tracks applied updates and failed patches. |
| **Monthly Review** | IT reviews vulnerability reports and takes action. |
