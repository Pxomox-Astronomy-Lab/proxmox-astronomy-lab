# üîê **CIS04-CONF-COMP-Autoplay-AllDomain-v1.0**

This document provides comprehensive configuration details for the AutoPlay security hardening Group Policy Object, implementing CIS Control 4 (Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software) through systematic AutoPlay and AutoRun disabling to prevent automatic execution of external media content across all domain-joined computers in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab infrastructure.

# üéØ **1. Introduction**

This section establishes the foundational context for AutoPlay security configuration within the enterprise Windows hardening framework.

## **1.1 Purpose**

This subsection explains how the AutoPlay GPO contributes to systematic security hardening by controlling automatic execution of removable media content and reducing attack surface through comprehensive AutoPlay management.

The AutoPlay GPO implements critical security controls by systematically disabling AutoPlay and AutoRun functionality across all media types, preventing automatic execution of potentially malicious content from USB drives, CDs, network drives, and other external media sources. This configuration ensures that media insertion operations maintain security boundaries while supporting legitimate media access workflows essential for enterprise operations, providing comprehensive protection against AutoRun-based malware delivery and social engineering attacks.

## **1.2 Scope**

This subsection defines the boundaries of AutoPlay security configuration within the Windows Server 2025 security baseline implementation.

The GPO applies comprehensive AutoPlay security controls to all domain-joined computers across the infrastructure, targeting Windows AutoPlay functionality through registry policy enforcement. The configuration scope encompasses non-volume device AutoPlay disabling, AutoRun command execution prevention, and comprehensive drive type AutoRun disabling, providing systematic protection against media-based attack vectors while maintaining operational functionality for manual media access and legitimate file operations.

# üîó **2. Dependencies & Relationships**

This section maps how the AutoPlay GPO integrates with other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security components, establishing both upstream and downstream dependencies.

## **2.1 Related Services**

This subsection identifies other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security services that interact with AutoPlay configuration management.

The AutoPlay GPO operates within the comprehensive endpoint security framework, coordinating with device control policies, malware protection systems, and user access controls to ensure consistent media security across the infrastructure while maintaining operational media access capabilities.
