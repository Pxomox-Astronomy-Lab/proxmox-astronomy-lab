# üóÑÔ∏è **Storage Services in Entra Hybrid Cloud**

# üîç **1. Overview**

This section documents the cloud-based storage solutions within our Entra Hybrid Cloud architecture that support backup, data retention, and secure storage capabilities for the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. These storage services provide critical functionality for maintaining data integrity, supporting disaster recovery operations, and enabling effective hybrid cloud integration across both on-premises and cloud environments.

Currently, our primary focus is on Azure Blob Storage (`backupskyvault01`), which serves as a secure repository for encrypted backups and auto-unseal keys for our on-premises HashiCorp Vault deployment.
