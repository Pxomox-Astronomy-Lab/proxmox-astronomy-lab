**Backup Implementation by Platform:**

| **Platform Type** | **Backup Solution** | **Schedule** | **Retention** | **Offsite Strategy** |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Linux VMs** | **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)** | **Weekly: 4 backups, Monthly: 1 backup** | **30 days** | **Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** |
| **Windows VMs** | **Veeam Backup & Replication Community** | **Weekly: 4 backups, Monthly: 1 backup** | **30 days** | **Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** |
| **Database Systems** | **Iperius Backup** | **Weekly: 4 backups, Monthly: 1 backup** | **30 days** | **Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** |
| **Configuration Data** | **Git + Infrastructure Backup** | **Continuous + Weekly** | **30 days local, 12 months offsite** | **Repository replication + S3** |

All backup data encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption with keys managed through centralized key management system.

## **6.2 Recovery Procedures**

This subsection provides recovery processes for different failure scenarios across the hybrid infrastructure.

**Tiered Recovery Strategy:** Recovery procedures are organized by scope and urgency, from individual service restoration to full infrastructure rebuild. All recovery operations are documented with step-by-step procedures and tested quarterly during scheduled maintenance windows.

**Recovery Scenarios:**

- **Individual VM Recovery:** Proxmox VE restore from PBS snapshots or Veeam backup with automated integrity verification
- **Database Point-in-Time Recovery:** Iperius backup restoration with transaction consistency validation  
- **Kubernetes Service Recovery:** PV snapshot restoration with pod recreation and service validation
- **Complete Site Recovery:** Infrastructure-as-Code deployment with automated service restoration and data synchronization
- **Configuration Rollback:** Git-based configuration management with automated rollback and validation testing
