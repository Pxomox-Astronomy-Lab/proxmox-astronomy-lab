# üîê **CIS04-CONF-COMP-Printing-DCs-v1.0**

This document provides comprehensive configuration details for the Domain Controller Print Spooler security hardening Group Policy Object, implementing CIS Control 4 (Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software) through complete Print Spooler service disabling on Domain Controllers in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab infrastructure.

# üéØ **1. Introduction**

This section establishes the foundational context for Domain Controller Print Spooler security configuration within the enterprise Windows hardening framework.

## **1.1 Purpose**

This subsection explains how the Domain Controller Printing GPO contributes to systematic security hardening by eliminating Print Spooler attack surface and preventing privilege escalation vulnerabilities on critical domain infrastructure.

The Domain Controller Printing GPO implements critical security controls by completely disabling the Print Spooler service on Domain Controllers, eliminating one of the most significant attack vectors for privilege escalation and lateral movement within Active Directory environments. This configuration ensures that Domain Controllers maintain the smallest possible attack surface by removing unnecessary services while preserving all essential domain controller functionality required for enterprise authentication and directory services operations.

## **1.2 Scope**

This subsection defines the boundaries of Domain Controller Print Spooler security configuration within the Windows Server 2025 security baseline implementation.

The GPO applies targeted Print Spooler service disabling exclusively to Domain Controllers across the infrastructure, targeting Windows System Services configuration through Security Settings policy enforcement. The configuration scope encompasses complete Print Spooler service shutdown on domain controllers while maintaining the comprehensive print security controls applied to other domain-joined computers through the complementary AllDomain printing GPO, ensuring appropriate security measures for different server roles within the infrastructure.

# üîó **2. Dependencies & Relationships**

This section maps how the Domain Controller Printing GPO integrates with other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security components, establishing both upstream and downstream dependencies.

## **2.1 Related Services**

This subsection identifies other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security services that interact with Domain Controller Print Service configuration management.

The Domain Controller Printing GPO operates within the comprehensive Active Directory security framework, coordinating with domain controller hardening policies, service management procedures, and critical infrastructure protection to ensure domain controller security while maintaining essential directory services functionality.
