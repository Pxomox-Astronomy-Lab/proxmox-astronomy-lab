# üîê **CISv8-10 Malware Defense Policy**

## üîç **1. Overview**

This policy establishes a comprehensive framework for protecting the Proxmox Astronomy Lab from malware threats through multiple layers of defense, automated monitoring, and structured incident response. By implementing these controls, we maintain a secure environment for both research and infrastructure operations.

### **1.1 Why This Policy Matters**

Malware defense is critical to securing enterprise assets from **unauthorized software, viruses, ransomware, and other threats**. This policy ensures that all systems are protected using **anti-malware tools, security monitoring, and automated remediation** within the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

### **1.2 Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **malware defense** through several complementary mechanisms that work together to provide comprehensive protection:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Endpoint Protection** | Linux systems use Chkrootkit, RKHunter, and Wazuh; Windows systems use Windows Defender and Wazuh Agent. |
| **Automated Updates & Monitoring** | All security software auto-updates and performs daily checks. |
| **Anti-Exploitation Features** | ASLR, DEP, and other protections enabled on all systems where supported. |
| **Centralized Logging & Threat Analysis** | Wazuh and Ansible monitor malware detections and system health. |
| **No Unnecessary Services** | Windows and Linux disable unused features to minimize attack surface. |

This comprehensive approach ensures that malware threats are prevented, detected, and remediated through multiple integrated control mechanisms.

---

## üìä **2. Compliance Mapping**

Our malware defense strategy aligns with multiple industry frameworks to ensure comprehensive coverage and best practices implementation. These mappings help demonstrate our security posture to stakeholders and ensure regulatory compliance.

The following table shows how this policy maps to established security frameworks:

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 10 ‚Äì Malware Defense |
| **NIST 800-53** | SI-3 ‚Äì Malicious Code Protection |
| **ISO 27001** | A.12.2 ‚Äì Protection from Malware |

By aligning with these frameworks, we ensure our malware defense strategy meets industry standards while providing protection appropriate to our environment.

## üë• **3. Responsibilities**

Effective malware defense requires clear role definition and accountability across the organization. Each role has specific responsibilities that contribute to our overall security posture.

The following table outlines the primary responsibilities for implementing and maintaining our malware defense controls:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Deploy and maintain anti-malware tools, monitor logs, and remediate threats. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Ensure all updates and malware defenses are enabled and functioning. |
| **Users** | Follow security best practices, report suspicious activity, and ensure updates are applied. |

This clear delineation of responsibilities ensures that malware defense remains a priority at all levels of the organization with appropriate oversight and execution.

## üõ°Ô∏è **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Malware Protection Configuration**

All systems within our environment must maintain active and properly configured malware protection to ensure consistent defense against threats.

The following table outlines the required anti-malware solutions for each system type:

| **System** | **Anti-Malware Solution** |
|------------|------------------|
| **Windows Servers & Desktops** | Windows Defender, Wazuh Agent |
| **Linux Servers & Workstations** | Chkrootkit, RKHunter, Wazuh Agent |
| **All Systems** | Auto-updates enabled, daily scans scheduled |

These solutions provide comprehensive protection while maintaining system performance. Users and administrators are prohibited from disabling or modifying these protections without proper authorization through the change management process.

---

### **4.2 Automated Updates & Patch Management**

Maintaining current security definitions and system patches is essential for effective malware defense. Our approach ensures that all systems receive timely updates to address emerging threats.

The following table outlines our update management approach:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Daily Malware Definition Updates** | All anti-malware software auto-updates. |
| **OS-Level Security Updates** | Managed via Ansible for Linux, Windows Update for Windows. |
| **Third-Party Software Updates** | Managed via Win-Get and apt-get. |

This automation ensures that security updates are applied consistently and promptly across all systems, reducing the window of vulnerability to known threats.

---

### **4.3 Anti-Exploitation Features**

Beyond traditional anti-malware tools, we implement system-level protections to prevent exploitation and limit the impact of potential compromise attempts.

The following table outlines the required anti-exploitation features by system type:

| **System** | **Exploit Protection Features** |
|------------|------------------|
| **Windows** | ASLR, DEP, Windows Defender Exploit Guard enabled. |
| **Linux** | ASLR, NX-bit, SELinux/AppArmor, Secure Boot enabled. |
| **All Systems** | Free anti-exploitation features enabled where applicable. |

These defense mechanisms create additional layers of protection that complement our anti-malware tools, making successful exploitation significantly more difficult.

---

### **4.4 Malware Detection & Logging**

Effective malware defense requires comprehensive visibility into security events across the environment. Our logging approach ensures that all relevant events are captured and properly reviewed.

The following table outlines our malware detection and logging requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Malware Alerts** | All detections are logged and reviewed via Wazuh. |
| **Unauthorized Software Detection** | Automatically flagged for investigation. |
| **Log Storage & Retention** | Logs retained for at least 90 days. |

This centralized logging approach enables us to identify patterns, correlate events across systems, and maintain an audit trail for security investigations.

---

### **4.5 Remediation & Incident Response**

When malware is detected, a structured response process ensures that threats are contained and eliminated in a timely manner.

The following table outlines our approach to malware remediation:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Automated Quarantine** | Detected malware is isolated where possible. |
| **Manual Investigation** | High-severity threats are escalated for review. |
| **Unauthorized Software Removal** | Any unapproved software must be removed or documented in the exception register. |

This tiered approach allows for immediate containment of threats while ensuring that complex scenarios receive appropriate investigation by qualified personnel.

---

### **4.6 Security Monitoring & Threat Intelligence**

Proactive monitoring and threat intelligence integration enhance our ability to detect and respond to emerging threats before they impact our environment.

The following table outlines our security monitoring approach:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Centralized Threat Monitoring** | Wazuh SIEM collects and analyzes malware data. |
| **System Integrity Checking** | Ansible ensures configurations remain secure. |
| **Regular Compliance Audits** | Security policies reviewed and adjusted annually. |

This continuous monitoring approach ensures that our malware defenses remain effective against an evolving threat landscape.
