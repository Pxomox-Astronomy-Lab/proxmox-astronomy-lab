# 📋 **1. Executive Summary**

This document provides comprehensive implementation guidance for the CIS08-AUDIT-COMP-SecurityLogging-AllDomain-v1.0 Group Policy Object (GPO), which configures Windows Security Event Log sizing and process creation command line auditing across all domain-joined computers in the radioastronomy.io enterprise environment. This GPO implements CIS Microsoft Windows Server 2025 Benchmark recommendations 18.10.26.2.1, 18.10.26.2.2, and 18.9.3.1, establishing enhanced security audit infrastructure with 196MB minimum Security log capacity and comprehensive process monitoring capabilities that significantly exceed baseline event logging requirements.

The policy addresses critical security monitoring requirements by configuring substantial Security log storage capacity (6x larger than standard Application/System logs) and enabling detailed process creation auditing with command line parameter capture. This implementation supports the enterprise's CIS Controls v8 baseline and dramatically enhances security monitoring capabilities through systematic security event management that provides extensive storage for security incidents, attack detection, and forensic analysis across domain infrastructure while enabling comprehensive process behavior monitoring for advanced threat detection.
