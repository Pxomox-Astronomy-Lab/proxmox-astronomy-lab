# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-07 Continuous Vulnerability Management Policy**

## **1. Overview**

### **Why This Policy Matters**

Vulnerability management is the process of identifying, evaluating, treating, and reporting on security vulnerabilities in systems and the software that runs on them. This policy establishes the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab's** approach to continuous vulnerability management, ensuring that **all assets are systematically monitored, assessed, and updated** to prevent security risks.

### **Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **continuous vulnerability management** through:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Systematic Vulnerability Detection** | Regular scanning and assessment of all systems for security weaknesses |
| **Risk-Based Remediation** | Prioritized approach to addressing vulnerabilities based on severity and impact |
| **Comprehensive Patch Management** | Structured process for applying security updates to all systems |
| **Exception Management** | Formal process for handling cases where vulnerabilities cannot be immediately remediated |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Ongoing assessment to detect new vulnerabilities as they emerge |

This policy applies to **all technology assets** within the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** including servers, workstations, network devices, applications, and cloud resources.

A comprehensive scanning program must be implemented according to the following requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Regular Scanning Schedule** | All systems must be scanned at minimum weekly intervals |
| **Comprehensive Coverage** | Scanning must include all assets in the inventory |
| **Multiple Scanning Methods** | Both authenticated and unauthenticated scanning where appropriate |
| **Scan Types** | Include vulnerability scanning, compliance checking, and configuration assessment |
| **Special Considerations** | Critical systems require additional scrutiny and validation |

### **4.2 Vulnerability Assessment Tools**

The following tools must be used for vulnerability assessment:

| **Tool** | **Purpose** | **Scan Frequency** | **Responsibility** |
|----------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Wazuh** | Security monitoring, compliance assessment | Continuous monitoring, daily scans | Security Administrator |
| **CIS-CAT Lite** | CIS benchmark compliance validation | Weekly | Security Administrator |
| **OpenSCAP** | Linux system security assessment | Weekly | Systems Administrator |
| **OpenVAS** | Network vulnerability scanning | Monthly | Security Administrator |
| **Ansible Security Automation** | Configuration validation | During deployments, weekly checks | Systems Administrator |

### **4.3 Vulnerability Risk Assessment**

Vulnerabilities must be evaluated based on risk and severity:

| **Severity Rating** | **CVSS Range** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | 9.0 - 10.0 | Vulnerabilities that allow immediate system compromise without authentication | Remote code execution, privilege escalation |
| **High** | 7.0 - 8.9 | Vulnerabilities with significant impact that are relatively easy to exploit | Authentication bypass, sensitive data exposure |
| **Medium** | 4.0 - 6.9 | Vulnerabilities that have moderate impact or are more difficult to exploit | Cross-site scripting, denial of service |
| **Low** | 0.1 - 3.9 | Minor vulnerabilities with limited impact | Information disclosure, outdated components |

### **4.4 Remediation Timelines**

Vulnerabilities must be remediated according to the following timelines:

| **Severity** | **Remediation Timeline** | **Required Actions** | **Exception Process** |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Critical** | 24 hours | Immediate patching or mitigation | Lab Owner approval with compensating controls |
| **High** | 5 days | Prioritized patching and remediation | Security Administrator approval with justification |
| **Medium** | 30 days | Scheduled remediation | Security Administrator approval |
| **Low** | 90 days | Include in regular maintenance cycles | Standard exception process |

### **4.5 Patch Management Process**

Security updates must be applied according to the following process:

| **Phase** | **Activities** | **Responsibility** | **Documentation** |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Preparation** | Identify patches, assess impact, create test plan | Systems Administrator | Patch assessment record |
| **Testing** | Apply in test environment, verify functionality | Systems Administrator | Test results documentation |
| **Approval** | Obtain change approval based on risk and impact | Change Management | Change record |
| **Deployment** | Implement patches in production using appropriate methods | Systems Administrator | Implementation log |
| **Verification** | Confirm successful installation, vulnerability resolution | Security Administrator | Verification report |

### **4.6 Special System Considerations**

Specialized systems require specific vulnerability management approaches:

| **System Type** | **Special Requirements** | **Approach** |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| **Production Servers** | Availability requirements, service continuity | Scheduled maintenance windows, rolling updates |
| **Research Infrastructure** | Data integrity, experiment continuity | Coordinated with research team, scheduled breaks |
| **Network Infrastructure** | Network stability, connectivity requirements | Careful change management, fallback planning |
| **Virtualization Hosts** | VM availability, shared resources | Host clustering, live migration |

### **4.7 Exception Management**

When vulnerabilities cannot be immediately remediated, exceptions must be managed as follows:

| **Exception Type** | **Required Documentation** | **Approval Requirements** | **Maximum Duration** |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Technical Constraint** | Detailed technical limitation | Security Administrator approval | 90 days |
| **Operational Impact** | Business impact assessment | Lab Owner approval | 90 days |
| **Vendor Dependency** | Vendor communication evidence | Security Administrator approval | Until vendor resolution |
| **Compensating Controls** | Control details and effectiveness | Security Administrator approval | 180 days |

All exceptions must be:

- Formally documented in the exception register
- Associated with compensating controls where possible
