# üîß **Proxmox Astronomy Lab - Phase 2: Structured Services & Research Validation**

# üîç **1. Overview**

Phase 2 **transformed the core infrastructure established in Phase 1** into a **structured, managed environment** with formalized processes, comprehensive monitoring, and initial research validation. This phase bridged the gap between raw infrastructure and functional research capabilities, implementing the service layer needed for efficient operations and scientific activities.

Where Phase 1 focused on building the foundation, Phase 2 emphasized **operationalizing the environment** through structured IT Service Management (ITSM), comprehensive observability, and validation of research capabilities through initial hydrogen line detection.

## **1.1 Key Phase 2 Goals**

| **Goal** | **Implementation Focus** |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Structured ITSM** | Formal change management, service catalog, and incident processes |
| **Comprehensive Monitoring** | Full-stack observability from infrastructure to applications |
| **Database Services** | Deployment of specialized database platforms for research data |
| **Security Operations** | Transition from static security to active monitoring and response |
| **Hydrogen Line Validation** | Confirmation of SDR capabilities for research activities |
