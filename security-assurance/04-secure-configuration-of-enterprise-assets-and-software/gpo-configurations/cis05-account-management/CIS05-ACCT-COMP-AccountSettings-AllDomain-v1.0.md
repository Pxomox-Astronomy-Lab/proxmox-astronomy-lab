# üö´ **CIS05-ACCT-COMP-AccountSettings-AllDomain-v1.0**

This Group Policy Object implements local account security restrictions for all domain-joined systems within the Windows Server 2025 Active Directory environment. The GPO prevents network access for accounts with blank passwords while maintaining console access for legitimate emergency scenarios through systematic local account access control and network security restriction enforcement across all domain infrastructure components.

The policy configuration implements CIS Control 5 (Account and Credential Management) requirements by establishing targeted restrictions on local accounts with blank passwords, preventing network-based exploitation while preserving legitimate local access capabilities for emergency administration and system recovery scenarios through coordinated security policy enforcement and operational flexibility management.

## **3.3 Implementation Standards**

This subsection establishes technical standards for local account settings policy deployment and enterprise network security management.

Local account settings policy implementation follows systematic deployment standards and operational procedures:

- **Deployment Method**: Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) with domain-wide policy application
- **Target Scope**: All domain-joined computers and local account authentication
- **Testing Protocol**: Controlled implementation through test systems with network access validation
- **Monitoring Integration**: Local account security event logging with network access attempt correlation
- **Documentation Standard**: Complete configuration mapping with CIS control references and emergency access procedures

# üîó **4. Implementation & Usage**

This section provides systematic guidance for implementing local account settings policy configuration and establishing network access protection across domain infrastructure.

## **4.1 Prerequisites**

This subsection identifies requirements for successful local account settings policy implementation within Active Directory domain infrastructure.

Local account settings policy implementation requires enterprise domain infrastructure with appropriate administrative access and comprehensive emergency access management capabilities:

- **Domain Infrastructure**: Windows Server 2025 Active Directory domain services with Group Policy application capability
- **Administrative Access**: Domain Admin or equivalent Group Policy management permissions for local account policy configuration
- **Emergency Access Procedures**: Established console access protocols and emergency administration workflows
- **Testing Environment**: Isolated systems for controlled policy testing and network access validation
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Security event monitoring capabilities for local account activity and network access attempt tracking

## **4.2 Monitoring**

This subsection establishes monitoring requirements for local account settings policy effectiveness and network security validation across domain infrastructure.

Local account settings monitoring leverages the centralized monitoring stack on proj-mon01 (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, AlertManager, Grafana Alloy) for systematic network access protection tracking and local account security event analysis. The monitoring philosophy of "if it can be collected, we do" applies to local account authentication attempts, network access restrictions, and policy enforcement effectiveness measurement through centralized security monitoring infrastructure.

Monitoring includes blank password detection correlation, network access attempt analysis, and policy compliance tracking through comprehensive local account security monitoring and automated alerting for unauthorized network authentication attempts.

# üîê **6. Security & Compliance**

This section establishes security framework alignment and compliance requirements for local account settings policy configuration within enterprise network security architecture.

## **6.1 Security Framework Alignment**

This subsection maps local account settings policy configuration to enterprise security frameworks and compliance requirements for systematic network access protection.

**Security Disclaimer**: The local account settings policy configuration documented in this guide represents a network security baseline establishment for Windows Server 2025 Active Directory infrastructure. These configurations should be thoroughly tested in non-production environments before deployment. While these templates follow CIS Controls v8 network security framework guidelines, organizations should validate policy compatibility with their specific emergency access requirements and business operational needs. The security research computing team maintains these configurations as implementation guidance rather than production security recommendations, and encourages consultation with dedicated security professionals for enterprise deployment validation.

### **Framework Mapping**

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** | **Implementation Evidence** |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **CIS Controls v8** | Control 5: Account and Credential Management | Local account settings policy implementing network access protection for blank password restrictions |
| **NIST AI RMF** | GOVERN-1.1: AI governance processes established | Network security supports AI workload access control and authentication security |
| **NIST CSF 2.0** | PR.AC-2: Physical and logical access to assets is managed and protected | Systematic local account network access restriction and authentication control |
| **NIST SP 800-171** | 3.1.1: Limit information system access to authorized users | Comprehensive network access restriction for accounts without proper authentication |

### **Security Controls Implementation**

| **CIS Control** | **Local Account Settings Implementation** | **Security Objective** |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **5.1** | Blank Password Network Restriction | Prevent network exploitation of accounts without password protection |
| **5.2** | Console Access Preservation | Maintain emergency access capability while enforcing network security |

## **6.2 Compliance Requirements**

This subsection establishes compliance validation requirements and evidence collection standards for local account settings policy implementation.

Local account settings policy configuration enables systematic compliance evidence collection through Group Policy Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) reporting and network security validation. Compliance validation requires regular policy application assessment and local account monitoring to maintain baseline network access protection posture across domain infrastructure components.

# üìã **7. Backup & Recovery**

This section establishes protection and recovery procedures for local account settings policy configuration and network security baseline preservation.

## **7.1 Protection Strategy**

This subsection defines systematic protection requirements for local account settings policy configuration and network security baseline preservation.

Local account settings policy configuration requires multi-tier protection strategy encompassing Group Policy backup, version control, and policy baseline preservation to ensure rapid network security recovery and systematic policy restoration capabilities.

### **Protection Tiers**

| **Tier** | **Scope** | **Method** | **Frequency** |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Tier 1** | GPO Backup | Group Policy Management Console backup | Daily automatic |
| **Tier 2** | Configuration Export | PowerShell GPO export and documentation | Weekly |
