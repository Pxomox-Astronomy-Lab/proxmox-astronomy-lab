# üõ°Ô∏è **CIS Security Policies**

## üîç **1. Overview**

This section documents the **implementation of CIS Controls v8.1** within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. These security policies provide a **structured framework for risk reduction** and establish a **robust security posture** aligned with industry best practices.

Our implementation focuses on **practical application** of CIS Controls, with policies that are both **comprehensive and actionable**. Each control area includes detailed implementation guidance, compliance verification methods, and mappings to other frameworks such as NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001.

---

## üìö **2. CIS Controls Framework**

The CIS Controls v8.1 framework consists of **18 control domains** that address critical security capability areas. Our implementation follows the CIS Implementation Groups (IG) model, with most controls implemented at the **IG2 level** appropriate for our environment.

The following table outlines the control domains and their implementation status:

| **Control #** | **Control Domain** | **Implementation Status** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **01** | Inventory & Control of Enterprise Assets | ‚úÖ Implemented | [Enterprise Asset Control](cisv8-01-inventory-enterprise-assets-policy.md) |

## üõ†Ô∏è **3. Implementation Approach**

### **3.1 Methodology**

Our implementation follows a structured approach:

1. **Policy Development** - Comprehensive documentation of requirements and standards
2. **Technical Implementation** - Automated enforcement through tooling and configurations
3. **Verification & Testing** - Regular assessment of control effectiveness
4. **Continuous Improvement** - Ongoing refinement based on testing and threat intelligence

### **3.2 Automation & Enforcement**

The lab leverages several key technologies to automate security control implementation:

| **Technology** | **Purpose** | **Related Controls** |
|---------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Ansible Playbooks** | Automated configuration and compliance enforcement | CIS 01, 02, 04, 07, 12 |
| **Wazuh SIEM** | Security monitoring, alerting, and compliance reporting | CIS 08, 09, 10, 13 |
| **Entra ID & Conditional Access** | Identity management and access control | CIS 05, 06, 14 |
| **Trivy & OpenSCAP** | Vulnerability assessment and compliance scanning | CIS 07, 16 |
| **GitOps Workflows** | Secure configuration management and version control | CIS 04, 16 |

This automation approach ensures consistent application of security controls while minimizing manual effort.

## üìä **4. Verification & Compliance Reporting**

### **4.1 Compliance Metrics**

The lab tracks several key metrics to assess security posture:

- **Control implementation percentage** - Coverage across all CIS control domains
- **Vulnerability remediation times** - Response efficiency for identified issues
- **Policy exceptions** - Tracked and documented deviations with compensating controls
- **Security incidents** - Frequency, type, and resolution metrics
- **Automation coverage** - Percentage of controls with automated enforcement

### **4.2 Reporting & Documentation**

Compliance reporting follows a structured approach:

| **Report Type** | **Frequency** | **Audience** | **Content** |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **CIS Compliance Dashboard** | Real-time | Lab Engineers | Current compliance status and alerts |
| **Vulnerability Summary** | Weekly | Security Administrator | Open vulnerabilities and remediation status |
| **Control Effectiveness Review** | Quarterly | Lab Owner | Comprehensive review of security controls |
| **Improvement Plan** | Quarterly | All Roles | Planned enhancements to security posture |

## üîÑ **5. Framework Mappings**

### **5.1 Mapping to Other Frameworks**

Our policies include mappings to related frameworks for comprehensive coverage:

| **Framework** | **Mapping Status** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **NIST 800-53 Rev 5** | Complete | framework-mappings/nist-800-53-mapping.md |
| **ISO 27001:2022** | Complete | framework-mappings/iso-27001-mapping.md |
| **MITRE ATT&CK** | Partial | framework-mappings/mitre-attack-mapping.md |

These mappings ensure our security controls satisfy multiple compliance requirements while maintaining a primary focus on the CIS framework.

## üîé **6. Getting Started with CIS Policies**

### **6.1 For New Users**

If you're new to the lab's security policies, we recommend the following starting points:

1. Review the security-architecture-overview.md for context
2. Explore the CIS Controls Implementation starting with Control 1
3. Reference the policy-exceptions-register.md for documented deviations
4. Check the security-monitoring/README.md documentation for enforcement details

### **6.2 For Implementers**

If you're involved in security implementation, these resources will be most helpful:

1. hardening-guides/README.md provide system-specific instructions
2. security-automation/README.md contains enforcement tools
3. security-monitoring/compliance-scanning.md details verification methods
4. security-monitoring/remediation-procedures.md outline response to compliance gaps
