# üìä **Proxmox Cluster Monitoring**

# üîç **1. Overview**

This section provides the foundational context for Proxmox Cluster Monitoring, explaining its purpose, scope, and implementation within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab's observability stack. It serves as the authoritative source for cluster-level monitoring from the virtualization layer.

## **1.1 Purpose**

This subsection clearly defines why Proxmox Cluster Monitoring exists in our environment, the problems it addresses, and what value it provides to operations.

The **Proxmox metrics server** provides a **native, low-overhead** method for collecting high-level cluster and node metrics. These metrics are **pushed directly to InfluxDB** and visualized in **Grafana**, offering a **more reliable** source of cluster-wide health data compared to scraped exporters.

This setup does **not replace Node Exporter**, but rather **complements it**:

- **Proxmox Metrics ‚Üí Best for Cluster-Wide Monitoring** (high-level, built-in, reliable)
- **Node Exporter ‚Üí Best for Deep-Dive System Analysis** (per-node, granular, detailed)

By integrating both, we get **the best of both worlds**: a **trustworthy cluster view** with **detailed system telemetry** when needed.

## **1.2 Scope**

This subsection defines the boundaries of what Proxmox Cluster Monitoring covers and explicitly states what is excluded, helping users understand its limitations and appropriate usage.

| **In Scope** | **Out of Scope** |
|--------------|------------------|
| Cluster-wide CPU and memory utilization | Process-level monitoring (use Node Exporter) |
| VM status and performance metrics | Container-level metrics (use cAdvisor) |
| Storage pool and datastore utilization | Application performance (use application exporters) |
| Node availability and status | Security monitoring (use Wazuh) |
| Aggregated I/O performance | Log aggregation (use Loki) |

The Proxmox Cluster Monitoring system integrates the built-in metrics capabilities of Proxmox VE with InfluxDB for storage and Grafana for visualization, providing insight into the virtualization layer's health and performance.

# üîÑ **3. Architecture & Data Flow**

This section provides the technical details necessary for understanding the Proxmox Cluster Monitoring implementation, configuration, and data flow, serving as the authoritative technical reference.

## **3.1 Component Architecture**

This subsection explains the technical architecture, component relationships, and design decisions that shape the Proxmox Cluster Monitoring implementation.

The Proxmox cluster monitoring stack consists of the following components:

| **Component** | **Role** |
|--------------|----------|
| **Proxmox Metrics Server** | Natively pushes cluster and VM stats to InfluxDB |
| **InfluxDB (lab-mon01)** | Stores Proxmox's metrics (running as a container) |
| **Grafana (lab-mon01)** | Visualizes cluster performance data |
| **AlertManager** | Uses Proxmox's direct metrics for more accurate alerting |

These components work together to provide a comprehensive view of the Proxmox cluster's health and performance, with data flowing from the Proxmox nodes to InfluxDB and then being visualized in Grafana.

## **3.2 Configuration Details**

This subsection provides specific configuration parameters, file locations, and settings required for proper implementation and operation of Proxmox Cluster Monitoring.

The Proxmox metrics server is configured through the Proxmox web interface under Datacenter > Options > Metrics Server:

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| **Enable** | Yes | Activates metrics collection |
| **Server** | 10.25.10.13 | InfluxDB server address |
| **Port** | 8086 | InfluxDB service port |
| **Transport** | HTTPS | Secure connection to InfluxDB |
| **Organization** | proxlab | InfluxDB organization |
| **Bucket** | proxmox | InfluxDB storage bucket |
| **Token** | [Secure Token] | Authentication token (stored in Vault) |
| **Verify Certificate** | Yes | Validates TLS certificate |

The configuration screenshot below shows the actual settings in the Proxmox interface:

![proxmox-metrics-server-settings](/assets/images/proxmox-metrics-server-settings.png)

The settings above establish a secure connection between Proxmox and InfluxDB, enabling metrics to be pushed directly without the need for external scrapers.

## **3.3 Advantages of Native Metrics**

This subsection explains the benefits of using Proxmox's native metrics capabilities compared to external scraping methods, providing justification for the design decisions.

### **3.3.1 Benefits Over External Scrapers**

Using Proxmox's built-in metrics server provides several key advantages:

- **Source of Truth Data**: Proxmox itself reports its state, eliminating discrepancies
- **Lower Overhead**: Push-based model reduces the impact of constant polling
- **Complete Coverage**: Captures metrics that external scrapers cannot access
- **VM-Aware Monitoring**: Understands the relationship between VMs and hosts
- **Reliable Status Information**: Accurately reflects Proxmox's internal view of component health

### **3.3.2 Metrics Comparison**

The following table compares the metrics available through Proxmox's native metrics server versus those collected by Node Exporter:

| **Metric Type** | **Proxmox Metrics Server** | **Node Exporter** |
|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Cluster-wide CPU/memory | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| VM I/O and network usage | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| VM power state awareness | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Storage pool utilization | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Node CPU temperature | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Per-core CPU usage | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Per-node disk I/O & partitions | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Process-level monitoring | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |

The comparison above demonstrates that both monitoring approaches have complementary strengths, justifying the use of both systems in parallel.
