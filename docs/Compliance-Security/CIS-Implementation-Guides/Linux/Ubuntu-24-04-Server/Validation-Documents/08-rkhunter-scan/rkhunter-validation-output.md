# üîç **RKHunter Scan Results**

## üîç **1. Overview**

This document presents the results of a RKHunter (Rootkit Hunter) scan performed on the **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS CIS hardened golden image**. The scan was conducted as part of the security validation process to ensure the system is free from rootkits, backdoors, and other malware.

RKHunter version 1.4.6 was used for this scan, providing comprehensive checking of system files, system commands, network interfaces, and system configuration for signs of compromise.

## üìä **2. Scan Summary**

| **Metric** | **Result** | **Assessment** |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Scan Date** | 2025-03-16 | Current |
| **RKHunter Version** | 1.4.6 | Up-to-date |
| **Rootkits Checked** | 499 | Comprehensive coverage |
| **Files Checked** | 145 | Thorough system examination |
| **Suspect Files** | 4 | Known false positives (analyzed below) |
| **Possible Rootkits** | 0 | Clean system |
| **Scan Duration** | 1 minute 2 seconds | Efficient execution |

The scan indicates a **clean system** with only known false positives detected.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **3. Key Findings**

### **3.1 System Command Checks**

System commands were verified for integrity and authenticity:

| **Check Type** | **Status** | **Assessment** |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **Strings Command** | ‚úÖ OK | No issues detected |
| **Shared Libraries** | ‚úÖ No preloading | No malicious library preloading |
| **LD_LIBRARY_PATH** | ‚úÖ Not found | No path manipulation |
| **File Properties** | ‚ö†Ô∏è 4 warnings | Known false positives (strings, size) |

The warnings on file properties are associated with known binaries and represent false positives:

- /usr/bin/size
- /usr/bin/strings
- /usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-size
- /usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-strings

### **3.2 Rootkit Detection**

Comprehensive checks for known rootkits revealed no issues:

| **Rootkit Category** | **Result** | **Assessment** |
|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| **Known Rootkit Files** | ‚úÖ None found | Clean system |
| **Suckit Rootkit** | ‚úÖ Clean | No indication of compromise |
| **Hidden Files/Directories** | ‚úÖ None suspicious | Only legitimate system hidden files |
| **Suspicious Strings** | ‚úÖ None found | No indicators of compromise |

### **3.3 Malware Checks**

Additional checks for malware indicators showed no signs of compromise:

| **Check Type** | **Result** | **Assessment** |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **Process Analysis** | ‚úÖ No suspicious files | Clean processes |
| **Login Backdoors** | ‚úÖ None found | Secure authentication |
| **Sniffer Logs** | ‚úÖ None found | No network monitoring malware |
| **Suspicious Directories** | ‚úÖ None found | Clean filesystem |
| **Shared Memory Segments** | ‚úÖ None suspicious | No covert channels detected |
| **Apache Backdoor** | ‚úÖ Not found | Web server secure |

### **3.4 Linux-Specific Checks**

Kernel-level checks revealed no signs of compromise:

| **Check Type** | **Result** | **Assessment** |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **Loaded Kernel Modules** | ‚úÖ OK | No suspicious modules |
| **Kernel Module Names** | ‚úÖ OK | No disguised modules |

### **3.5 Network Checks**

Network interface and port checks showed no indications of compromise:

| **Check Type** | **Result** | **Assessment** |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **Backdoor Ports** | ‚úÖ None found | No covert communication channels |
| **Promiscuous Interfaces** | ‚úÖ None found | No network sniffing detected |

### **3.6 Local Host Checks**

System configuration and account checks revealed no security issues:

| **Check Type** | **Result** | **Assessment** |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **System Startup Files** | ‚úÖ Clean | No malware in startup |
| **UID 0 Accounts** | ‚úÖ None found | No unauthorized root accounts |
| **Passwordless Accounts** | ‚úÖ None found | All accounts secured |
| **SSH Root Access** | ‚úÖ Not allowed | Secure SSH configuration |
| **SSH Protocol v1** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning | False positive, only v2 enabled |
| **Hidden Files/Directories** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning | Legitimate system files |

---

## üîÑ **4. False Positive Analysis**

The scan produced several warnings that have been analyzed and confirmed as false positives:

| **Warning** | **Analysis** | **Mitigation** |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Binary file warnings** | Standard system binaries with expected properties | Whitelisted in configuration |
| **SSH Protocol v1** | Configuration is secure but RKHunter misinterpreted comment in config | Verified SSH config - only Protocol 2 is enabled |
| **Hidden files warning** | Standard system hidden directories (.udev, .initramfs) | Whitelisted in configuration |

These warnings are consistent with a clean CIS-hardened system and do not represent security issues.

---

## üîí **5. Security Assessment**

Based on the RKHunter scan results, the system demonstrates a strong security posture:

- **No rootkits or backdoors** detected
- **System commands integrity** verified
- **Network interfaces** not in promiscuous mode
- **No unauthorized accounts** or security weaknesses
- **Minimal false positives** aligned with expected configuration

This scan confirms compliance with **CIS Control 10.5** (Anti-malware scanning) and supports the system's overall security posture.
