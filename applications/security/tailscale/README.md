Split tunneling is configured to route only traffic destined for lab resources through the Tailscale connection, while all other traffic uses the client's default internet connection.

Key design elements include:

- Integration with Entra ID for identity management via SCIM
- Access control through network ACLs based on group membership
- Split DNS configuration for radioastronomy.io domain
- Dedicated exit nodes for specific service access
