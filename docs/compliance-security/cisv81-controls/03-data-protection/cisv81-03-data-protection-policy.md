# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-03 Data Protection Policy**

## **1. Overview**

### **Why This Policy Matters**

Data protection is essential for safeguarding **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** within the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**. This policy defines **data classification, encryption, retention, access control, and disposal** to prevent unauthorized access, modification, or loss.

### **Key Objectives**

The following key objectives support effective data protection:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Data Classification** | Enforce structured labeling for public, internal, confidential, and restricted data. |
| **Access Controls** | Implement RBAC, ACLs, and MFA for data protection. |
| **Encryption Standards** | Use BitLocker, LUKS, AES-256, and TLS 1.3 for at-rest and in-transit encryption. |
| **Retention & Disposal** | Define lifecycle policies for secure data retention and deletion. |
| **Security Monitoring** | Utilize Wazuh SIEM for data access logging and alerts. |

This policy applies to **scientific datasets, telemetry, and operational data** across **servers, databases, cloud services, and storage systems**.

---

## **2. Compliance Mapping**

This policy aligns with industry security frameworks to ensure compliance:

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 3 â€“ Data Protection |
| **NIST 800-53** | SC-12 â€“ Cryptographic Protection |
| **ISO 27001** | A.8.2 â€“ Information Classification |

---

## **3. Responsibilities**

Defined roles and responsibilities ensure proper data handling and security:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Enforce encryption, implement access controls, and manage retention policies. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Monitor data access, ensure storage security, and assist in classification. |
| **Users** | Follow handling guidelines, report unauthorized access, and avoid storing sensitive data in unapproved locations. |

---

## **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Data Inventory & Classification**

Maintaining an up-to-date inventory ensures accountability and data security:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Annual Data Inventory** | IT conducts audits to track data storage, ownership, and classification. |
| **Data Labeling** | All datasets must be assigned a classification: Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted. |
| **New Data Reporting** | Any newly created sensitive data must be reported for tracking. |

#### **Data Classification Levels**

| **Classification** | **Definition** |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Public** | No risk if disclosed (e.g., general research papers). |
| **Internal** | Limited risk (e.g., system logs, research datasets). |
| **Confidential** | High risk (e.g., API keys, credentials, telemetry). |
| **Restricted** | Critical risk (e.g., password vaults, sensitive scientific data). |

---

### **4.2 Data Protection & Access Control**

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and encryption enforce secure access policies:

| **Data Type** | **Encryption** | **Access Control** |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| File Storage (NTFS, SMB) | BitLocker, LUKS | ACLs, RBAC |
| Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) | AES-256, TLS | SQL Roles, LDAP |
| API Keys & Secrets | Azure Key Vault | RBAC, MFA |
| Network Storage | SMBv3 with encryption | LDAP, Group Policy |

Unauthorized data access attempts trigger **Wazuh security alerts**, and access permissions are reviewed **annually**.

---

### **4.3 Data Handling & Retention**

Retention policies ensure compliance while securing critical datasets:

| **Data Type** | **Retention Period** |
|--------------|------------------|
| Logs (SIEM, Wazuh) | 1 Year |
| Research Data | 5 Years |
| System Backups | 90 Days |
| Financial & Compliance Records | 7 Years |

All expired data must be securely deleted per **approved disposal policies**.

---

### **4.4 Data Disposal & Secure Deletion**

Secure deletion prevents data recovery and ensures compliance:

| **Data Type** | **Destruction Method** |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Printed Documents | Cross-cut shredding, locked bins |
| Portable Media (USB, SSD, DVD) | Physical destruction (shred, crush, disassemble) |
| HDDs & Magnetic Media | Overwriting (DoD 5220.22-M), Degaussing, Physical Destruction |
| Cloud Storage | Vendor-specific permanent deletion processes |

**Destruction events must be logged**, with proof of destruction obtained if a third party is used.

---

### **4.5 Logging & Monitoring of Sensitive Data**

Access logs ensure compliance and security auditing:

| **System** | **Logging Method** | **Retention** |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| File Access Logs | Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring | 1 Year |
| Database Access | SQL Audit Logs | 1 Year |
| Network Traffic | Fortigate Firewall Logs | 6 Months |
| Cloud Storage | Azure Logging | 1 Year |

Unauthorized access attempts trigger **immediate security alerts**.
