# üß† **Vector Databases**

Vector database systems and semantic search infrastructure supporting AI/ML applications, embedding storage, and similarity-based retrieval for astronomical research and enterprise knowledge management. This directory provides vector database implementations optimized for high-dimensional data, semantic search capabilities, and machine learning operations across the Proxmox Astronomy Lab ecosystem.

## **Overview**

The Vector Databases directory encompasses comprehensive vector database technologies designed to store, index, and retrieve high-dimensional vector embeddings for semantic search, similarity analysis, and machine learning applications. This implementation enables sophisticated semantic search capabilities, embedding-based retrieval, similarity analysis, and AI/ML operations supporting both astronomical research requirements and enterprise knowledge discovery through advanced vector database capabilities.

This directory establishes the foundation for semantic search and similarity-based operations, enabling intelligent content discovery, embedding-based retrieval systems, and machine learning operations that support both research applications and enterprise knowledge management across the astronomy platform ecosystem.
