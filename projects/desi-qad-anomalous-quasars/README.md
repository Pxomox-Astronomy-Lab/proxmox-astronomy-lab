# üîç **DESI QSO Anomaly Detection Project**

This project conducts a systematic, unbiased search for anomalous quasar spectra in DESI DR1's 1.6 million quasar dataset using 1D Convolutional Variational Autoencoders and distributed computing infrastructure. Through unsupervised machine learning and expert validation, this high-risk, high-impact research aims to discover rare physical phenomena, novel object classes, and unexpected astrophysical processes while demonstrating enterprise-grade AI/ML capabilities on the hybrid Kubernetes platform.

# üéØ **1. Introduction**
