# üîê **Security Assurance**

Comprehensive security and compliance framework implementing CIS Controls v8, NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0, and NIST AI Risk Management Framework with OSCAL automation and systematic evidence collection across the Proxmox Astronomy Lab enterprise infrastructure. This directory serves as the central navigation hub for security control implementation, compliance validation, automated assessment, and comprehensive evidence management supporting enterprise-grade security operations and regulatory compliance requirements.

## **Overview**

The Security Assurance directory represents the comprehensive security and compliance framework designed to implement systematic security controls, validate compliance posture, and maintain continuous security assessment across the Proxmox Astronomy Lab ecosystem. This implementation baselines to CIS Controls v8 with NIST CSF 2.0 framework alignment and cross-mapping to NIST SP 800-171, enhanced by dedicated OSCAL compliance automation (proj-oscal01) and CIS benchmarking platforms (proj-cisbench) for systematic validation and evidence collection.

This directory establishes navigation to enterprise-grade security operations through systematic control implementation, automated compliance validation, comprehensive evidence collection, and continuous security monitoring while supporting both research computing requirements and enterprise security standards across the astronomy research platform.

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY DISCLAIMER**

*The security implementations described in this framework are part of ongoing baseline establishment and should not be considered production-ready specifications. Our team consists of research computing professionals, not dedicated security experts. All security measures are implemented as best-effort implementations based on industry standards. For production deployments requiring formal security validation, engage qualified security professionals for comprehensive review and approval.*
