# üîí **5. Security & Compliance**

This section documents security controls and compliance alignment for enterprise-grade astronomical computing infrastructure.

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY DISCLAIMER**

*The security implementations described in this document are part of ongoing baseline establishment and should not be considered production-ready specifications. Our team consists of research computing professionals, not dedicated security experts. All security measures are implemented as best-effort implementations based on industry standards. For production deployments requiring formal security validation, engage qualified security professionals for comprehensive review and approval.*

## **5.1 Security Controls**

This subsection documents specific security measures and their verification methods.

**Enterprise-grade security implementation guided by industry standards.** Security controls are implemented systematically across the 7-node hybrid Kubernetes and VM infrastructure to protect astronomical research data and computational resources while maintaining operational efficiency and compliance with research computing security requirements.

[Overview of security controls and protection mechanisms. Focus on what is protected and how verification occurs.]

## **5.2 CIS Controls Mapping**

This subsection provides explicit mapping to CIS Controls v8, documenting compliance status and implementation evidence.

**Baseline Standards:** CIS Controls v8, NIST AI Risk Management Framework  
**Framework:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0  
**Mapping to:** NIST SP 800-171

| **CIS Control** | **Implementation Status** | **Evidence Location** | **Assessment Date** |
|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| [CIS.X.Y] | [Compliant/Partial/Planned] | [Evidence path/link] | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| [Additional mappings specific to document subject] | [Status] | [Evidence] | [Date] |

## **5.3 Framework Compliance**

This subsection demonstrates how controls satisfy requirements across multiple compliance frameworks.

Cross-framework compliance approach aligns CIS Controls v8 with NIST CSF 2.0 and maps implementation evidence to NIST SP 800-171 requirements. This multi-framework strategy ensures comprehensive security coverage while maintaining research computing operational efficiency and scientific data accessibility requirements.

# üíæ **6. Backup & Recovery**

This section documents comprehensive data protection strategies and recovery processes across the 7-node Proxmox Astronomy Lab infrastructure.

## **6.1 Protection Strategy**

This subsection details backup approaches, schedules, and retention policies implemented across hybrid Kubernetes and VM infrastructure.

**Comprehensive Multi-Tier Backup Strategy:** The Proxmox Astronomy Lab implements enterprise-grade data protection across three distinct tiers: Proxmox-native VM backups, application-specific database backups, and Kubernetes persistent volume protection. All backup operations are monitored via mon01 with automated alerting for backup failures or retention policy violations.

| **Data Type** | **Backup Frequency** | **Retention** | **Recovery Objective** | **Method** |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Proxmox VMs** | Daily 2:00 AM | 7 daily, 4 weekly, 6 monthly | RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 24 hours | Proxmox VE native backup |
| **PostgreSQL Databases** | Every 6 hours | 14 days + [Iperius if configured] | RTO: 1 hour, RPO: 6 hours | pg_dump + WAL archiving |
| **MongoDB Collections** | Daily 3:00 AM | 30 days | RTO: 2 hours, RPO: 24 hours | mongodump + gridfs |
| **Kubernetes PVs** | Daily via CSI snapshots | 14 days | RTO: 2 hours, RPO: 24 hours | Longhorn/local-path snapshots |
| **Configuration Files** | Git commit triggers | Unlimited (Git history) | RTO: 30 minutes, RPO: Real-time | Git repository sync |
| **Monitoring Data** | Weekly | 90 days (metrics), 30 days (logs) | RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 7 days | Prometheus/Loki native backup |

**Storage Infrastructure:** Primary backups stored on dedicated backup storage with secondary replication to geographically separated location. All backup data encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption with keys managed through centralized key management system.

## **6.2 Recovery Procedures**

This subsection provides recovery processes for different failure scenarios across the hybrid infrastructure.

**Tiered Recovery Strategy:** Recovery procedures are organized by scope and urgency, from individual service restoration to full infrastructure rebuild. All recovery operations are documented with step-by-step procedures and tested quarterly during scheduled maintenance windows.

**Recovery Scenarios:**

- **Individual VM Recovery:** Proxmox VE restore from daily snapshots with automated integrity verification
- **Database Point-in-Time Recovery:** PostgreSQL WAL replay and MongoDB oplog recovery with transaction consistency validation  
- **Kubernetes Service Recovery:** PV snapshot restoration with pod recreation and service validation
- **Complete Site Recovery:** Infrastructure-as-Code deployment with automated service restoration and data synchronization
- **Configuration Rollback:** Git-based configuration management with automated rollback and validation testing

**Recovery Validation:** All recovery operations include automated validation testing to ensure data integrity, service functionality, and performance baseline compliance before declaring recovery complete.

## **üìã Template Usage Guidelines**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Graceful Section Numbering**

**NEVER renumber sections to close gaps.** The knowledge base system requires consistent section numbering for RAG optimization. If a section is omitted, use graceful drop numbering:

- **Correct**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (Section 5 omitted, numbering preserved)
- **WRONG**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Renumbered to close gap - BREAKS RAG SYSTEM)

**All documents MUST end on Section 9.4** - this is the standard termination point for the knowledge base.

### **Document Length Targets**
- **Directory READMEs**: 150-300 lines, focus on organization and relationships
- **Implementation Guides**: 300-600 lines, include necessary technical details
- **Policy Documents**: 200-400 lines, focus on requirements and compliance
- **Architecture Documents**: 400-800 lines, comprehensive technical coverage

### **Pre-Filled Static Content**

#### **Section 5: Security & Compliance**
- **Security Disclaimer**: Pre-filled with standard disclaimer about baseline establishment and non-production status
- **Framework Alignment**: Always uses CIS v8, NIST AI RMF baseline with NIST CSF 2.0 framework mapping to NIST SP 800-171
- **Only Variable Content**: Specific CIS control mappings in table format

#### **Section 6: Backup & Recovery**
- **Protection Strategy**: Complete multi-tier backup strategy pre-filled
- **Recovery Procedures**: Standard tiered recovery approach pre-filled
- **Only Variable Content**: Document-specific backup types or special considerations
- **Iperius Configuration**: Note in PostgreSQL backup entry if Iperius backup software is configured

#### **Section 4.2: Monitoring**
- **mon01 Stack**: Always references centralized monitoring with Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, AlertManager, Grafana Alloy
- **Philosophy**: "If it can be collected, we do" approach consistently applied

#### **Section 2.3: Responsibility Matrix**
- **Standard Four-Tier**: Helpdesk, Operations, Engineering, Security roles consistently used

### **Section 3 Guidance by Document Type**
- **Directory READMEs**: Focus on structure, organization, file types, relationships
- **How-to Guides**: Include step-by-step procedures and configuration examples
- **Architecture Docs**: Detailed technical specifications and design rationale
- **Policy Docs**: Requirements, controls, and compliance frameworks

### **Content Principles**
- **Clarity over Completeness**: Better to be clear and concise than comprehensive and confusing
- **Link Don't Repeat**: Reference detailed implementation docs rather than duplicating content
- **Focus on Purpose**: Stay aligned with the document's primary objective
- **Avoid Scope Creep**: Resist the urge to add "just a bit more detail"
- **Token Efficiency**: Static content prevents repetitive generation of standard sections

- ‚úÖ Scope is well-defined and maintained
- ‚úÖ Technical details are appropriate for document type
- ‚úÖ Relationships to other documents are clear
- ‚úÖ Length is appropriate for the content and audience
