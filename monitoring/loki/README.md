# üìä **Loki Logging System**

# üîç **1. Overview**

This section provides the foundational context for Loki, explaining its purpose, scope, and implementation within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab's observability stack. Loki serves as the central logging solution that complements Prometheus metrics and Grafana visualizations.

## **1.1 Purpose**

This subsection clearly defines why Loki exists in our environment, the problems it addresses, and what value it provides to operations and security functions.

Loki serves as the **centralized logging solution** for the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, aggregating logs from infrastructure components. Unlike traditional log aggregation systems, Loki is **efficient and index-free**, designed to work seamlessly with **Promtail** and **Grafana** for log visualization and querying.

## **1.2 Scope**

This subsection defines the boundaries of what Loki covers and explicitly states what is excluded, helping users understand its limitations and appropriate usage.

| **In Scope** | **Out of Scope** |
|-------------|------------------|
| Aggregation of system logs | Advanced log correlation & AI analysis (future) |
| Promtail log scraping | Long-term log retention beyond 30 days |
| Integration with Grafana | SIEM-level security auditing |
| Compliance-required log capture | Full packet capture |
| Basic LogQL querying | Complex event correlation |

Loki is deployed on `lab-mon01` and ingests logs from various system components, including authentication, kernel, syslog, and security tools like Fail2Ban.

## **1.3 Target Audience**

This subsection identifies who should use this document, what prior knowledge they should have, and how different roles might utilize the information presented.

This document is intended for:
- Infrastructure Engineers responsible for monitoring

# üõ†Ô∏è **3. Technical Documentation**

This section provides the technical details necessary for Loki implementation, configuration, and troubleshooting, serving as the authoritative technical reference.

## **3.1 Architecture & Components**

This subsection explains the technical architecture, component relationships, and design decisions that shape the Loki implementation.

Loki operates within a three-component architecture:

1. **Loki Server** - Central service that stores and indexes logs
2. **Promtail Agents** - Deployed on monitored systems to collect and forward logs
3. **Grafana Frontend** - Provides log visualization and querying interface

Loki is deployed on `lab-mon01` (10.25.10.13) and listens on port 3100 for incoming logs from Promtail agents. It indexes logs based on labels rather than content, making it highly efficient for storage while maintaining query capabilities.

## **3.2 Configuration Details**

This subsection provides specific configuration parameters, file locations, and settings required for proper implementation and operation of Loki.

Loki's configuration is stored in `/etc/loki/config.yaml` with the following key parameters:

```yaml
# LOKI CONFIGURATION - PROXMOX ASTRONOMY LAB
# Centralized log aggregation using Loki.
# - Logs system, authentication, security, and package management events.
# - Retains logs for 30 days before compaction.
# - Integrated with Promtail for log collection.
# - Supports Grafana for log visualization.

server:
  # Loki's internal HTTP server for API access and log ingestion.
  http_listen_port: 3100

storage:
  # Storage configuration defines how and where logs are stored
  filesystem:
    directory: /var/lib/loki/chunks

schema_config:
  configs:
    - from: 2023-01-01
      store: boltdb-shipper
      object_store: filesystem
      schema: v11
      index:
        prefix: index_
        period: 24h

compactor:
  # Compaction settings for log storage efficiency
  working_directory: /var/lib/loki/compactor
  retention_enabled: true
  retention_delete_delay: 2h
  retention_delete_worker_count: 150

limits_config:
  # Log retention period settings
  retention_period: 720h  # 30 days

# Additional settings omitted for brevity
```

Promtail configuration on monitored systems includes the log sources to be collected:

```yaml
server:
  http_listen_port: 9080

positions:
  filename: /tmp/positions.yaml

clients:
  - url: http://10.25.10.13:3100/loki/api/v1/push

scrape_configs:
  # System logs via journalctl
  - job_name: system
    journal:
      max_age: "24h"
      labels:
        job: system
        hostname: ${HOSTNAME}

  # Auth logs for authentication events
  - job_name: auth
    static_configs:
    - targets: [ "localhost" ]
      labels:
        job: auth
        __path__: /var/log/auth.log
        hostname: ${HOSTNAME}

  # Additional log sources omitted for brevity
```

The configuration details above should be specific enough to enable complete implementation without requiring additional research.

## **3.3 Log Sources & Job Configuration**

This subsection documents the specific log sources collected by Loki through Promtail agents, establishing the log collection architecture.

Loki ingests logs from the following sources through Promtail:

| **Job Name** | **Log Path** | **Purpose** | **Compliance Control** |
|-------------|-------------|------------|------------------------|
| `system` | `journalctl` | General system events | CIS.8.2, NIST AU-3 |
| `auth` | `/var/log/auth.log` | Authentication events, SSH logins | CIS.8.1, NIST AC-7 |
| `kern` | `/var/log/kern.log` | Kernel messages and warnings | CIS.8.2, NIST SI-4 |
| `syslog` | `/var/log/syslog` | General system logs | CIS.8.2, NIST AU-3 |
| `dpkg` | `/var/log/dpkg.log` | Package installation logs | CIS.8.5, NIST CM-6 |
| `fail2ban` | `/var/log/fail2ban.log` | Banned IPs and intrusion attempts | CIS.8.10, NIST SI-4 |

The table above provides a comprehensive view of log sources collected by Loki, ensuring all critical system events are captured according to compliance requirements.

The troubleshooting table above helps operators quickly identify and resolve common issues without extensive investigation or escalation.

## **4.3 Integration with Grafana**

This subsection documents how Loki integrates with Grafana for log visualization and querying, providing the practical information needed for effective log analysis.

Loki logs are visualized in Grafana using the following configuration:

- **Grafana Data Source**: Named `Loki` with URL `http://10.25.10.13:3100`
- **Authentication**: None (internal network only)
- **Access Method**: Server (proxy through Grafana)

Key dashboards include:

| **Dashboard** | **Purpose** | **URL** |
|--------------|------------|--------|
| SSH Access Logs | Authentication monitoring | [https://grafana.lab.local/d/ssh-logs](https://grafana.lab.local/d/ssh-logs) |
| System Events | General system monitoring | [https://grafana.lab.local/d/system-events](https://grafana.lab.local/d/system-events) |
| Security Monitoring | Fail2Ban and auth failures | [https://grafana.lab.local/d/security-events](https://grafana.lab.local/d/security-events) |
| Package Management | Software installation tracking | [https://grafana.lab.local/d/package-events](https://grafana.lab.local/d/package-events) |

Basic LogQL queries for common tasks:

```
# View authentication failures
{job="auth"} |= "Failed"

# View kernel errors
{job="kern"} |= "error" or {job="kern"} |= "fail"

# View package installations
{job="dpkg"} |= "installed"
```

The integration details above provide practical guidance for using Loki's log data through Grafana's visualization capabilities.
