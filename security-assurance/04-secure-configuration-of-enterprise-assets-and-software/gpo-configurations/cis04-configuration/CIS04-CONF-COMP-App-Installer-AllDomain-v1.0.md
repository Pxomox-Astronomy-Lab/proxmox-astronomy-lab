# üîê **CIS04-CONF-COMP-App-Installer-AllDomain-v1.0**

This document provides comprehensive configuration details for the Windows App Installer (winget) security hardening Group Policy Object, implementing CIS Control 4 (Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software) across all domain-joined computers in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab infrastructure.

# üéØ **1. Introduction**

This section establishes the foundational context for App Installer security configuration within the enterprise Windows hardening framework.

## **1.1 Purpose**

This subsection explains how the App Installer GPO contributes to systematic security hardening by controlling Windows package management capabilities and reducing attack surface through configuration management.

The App Installer GPO implements systematic security controls for Windows App Installer (winget) functionality, preventing potential security vulnerabilities through experimental features, hash validation bypasses, and protocol handlers that could be exploited for malware distribution or system compromise. This configuration ensures that package management operations maintain security boundaries while supporting legitimate software deployment workflows essential for enterprise operations.

## **1.2 Scope**

This subsection defines the boundaries of App Installer security configuration within the Windows Server 2025 security baseline implementation.

The GPO applies comprehensive security controls to all domain-joined computers, targeting Windows App Installer functionality through registry-based policy enforcement. The configuration scope encompasses experimental feature control, hash override prevention, malware scan bypass restrictions, protocol handler security, and certificate validation enforcement, providing systematic protection against package management attack vectors while maintaining operational functionality for approved software deployment processes.

# üîó **2. Dependencies & Relationships**

This section maps how the App Installer GPO integrates with other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security components, establishing both upstream and downstream dependencies.

## **2.1 Related Services**

This subsection identifies other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security services that interact with App Installer configuration management.

The App Installer GPO operates within the comprehensive Windows security baseline, coordinating with Windows Defender policies for malware protection, software restriction policies for application control, and certificate validation systems for package authenticity verification. Integration with centralized logging ensures App Installer security events are captured within the security monitoring framework.
