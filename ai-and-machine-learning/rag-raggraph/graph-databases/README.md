# üï∏Ô∏è **Graph Databases**

Graph database infrastructure for knowledge graphs and relationship modeling in astronomical research workflows, enabling complex relationship queries and knowledge discovery.

## **Overview**

This directory contains graph database implementations supporting knowledge graph construction and relationship modeling across our astronomical computing infrastructure. Graph databases enable complex relationship queries, knowledge discovery, and semantic data modeling essential for advanced astronomical research and AI-powered analysis.

**Primary Focus**: Neo4j graph database deployment for astronomical knowledge graphs, particularly supporting documentation relationships, research connections, and semantic data modeling.

## **Current Implementation**

### **Neo4j Graph Database**

- **Container Deployment**: Neo4j community edition with browser interface
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Astronomical object relationships and research connections
- **Use Cases**: Documentation navigation, research paper relationships, data lineage tracking
- **Infrastructure**: Deployed on proj-neo4j01 with optimized memory configuration

### **Astronomical Knowledge Modeling**

- **Object Relationships**: Galaxy clusters, void structures, and environmental connections
- **Research Connections**: Paper citations, author networks, and collaboration graphs
- **Data Lineage**: Pipeline dependencies and processing workflow relationships

## **Key Features**

- **Relationship Queries**: Complex multi-hop relationship discovery and analysis
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Pattern recognition in astronomical research connections
- **Semantic Modeling**: Rich metadata and relationship modeling capabilities
- **Cypher Queries**: Powerful graph query language for complex data exploration

## **Integration Points**

- **[AI Infrastructure](../README.md)** - Core AI/ML platform integration
- **[RAG Systems](../rag-raggraph/README.md)** - Knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval
- **[Documentation RAG](../rag-raggraph/documentation-rag/README.md)** - Documentation relationship modeling
