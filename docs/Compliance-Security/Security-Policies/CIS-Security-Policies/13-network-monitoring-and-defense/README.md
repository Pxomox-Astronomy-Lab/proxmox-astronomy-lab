# üîç **CIS Control 13: Network Monitoring and Defense**

## üõ°Ô∏è **1. Introduction**

CIS Control 13 forms a critical component of our defense-in-depth strategy, establishing comprehensive visibility into network traffic and automated detection of security threats. This control ensures that our network environment remains monitored, protected, and compliant with security best practices.

Effective **network monitoring and defense** are essential for **detecting security threats, preventing unauthorized access, and enforcing segmentation policies**. **CIS Control 13** mandates that all network activity is **monitored, logged, and analyzed** to ensure **secure and compliant network operations**.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** employs **real-time network monitoring, logging, and segmentation controls** to comply with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

The following table outlines our key network monitoring and defense components and their implementation:

| **Key Network Security Features** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Traffic Monitoring & Logging** | Wazuh and Loki deployed for real-time monitoring. |
| **VLAN Segmentation & Access Control** | Strict VLAN policies enforce network isolation. |
| **Restricted Remote Access** | No direct external access permitted to lab resources. |
| **Hardware Security & Detection** | Network policies enforced on labswitch01 and labswitch02. |
| **Continuous Review & Auditing** | Policies reviewed and updated monthly. |

This integrated approach ensures both network visibility and proactive threat detection throughout our environment.

## üéØ **2. Scope**

This control applies to all network communications within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab environment, establishing clear requirements for traffic monitoring, logging, and security event detection.

The following table outlines the scope boundaries for our network monitoring and defense implementation:

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | All network devices, monitoring tools, and access control policies governing VLANs and segmentation. |
| **Out-of-Scope** | Temporary lab networks and isolated test environments. |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 13, NIST 800-53 (SC-7), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.13.1). |

This defined scope ensures that security resources are focused on protecting systems with the highest risk exposure while maintaining compliance with applicable frameworks.

## üîÑ **3. Network Security Implementation**

### **3.1 Traffic Monitoring & Logging**

Visibility into network activity is essential for detecting and responding to potential security incidents. Our monitoring strategy provides comprehensive coverage of all network traffic.

The following table details our traffic monitoring and logging implementation:

| **Security Measure** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Traffic Analysis** | Wazuh and Loki deployed for real-time monitoring. |
| **Alerting & Detection** | Suspicious activity generates security alerts. |
| **Log Retention** | Logs stored for **90 days** for forensic investigation. |

This monitoring infrastructure ensures that security events are promptly detected and investigated, reducing the potential impact of security incidents.

### **3.2 VLAN Segmentation & Access Control**

Network segmentation provides essential protection by limiting the potential impact of security breaches and enforcing access control policies.

The following table outlines our VLAN segmentation implementation:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **VLAN Segmentation** | VLAN-to-VLAN communication restricted based on security policies. |
| **Firewall Policy Enforcement** | FortiGate firewall rules enforce traffic control. |
| **Logging & Alerts** | Unauthorized VLAN traffic is flagged for review. |

This segmentation approach contains potential security incidents and prevents lateral movement across the network.

### **3.3 Remote Access Security & Physical Network Controls**

A fundamental principle of our network security is that internal resources should not be directly accessible from external networks. This Zero Trust approach significantly reduces our attack surface.

The following table outlines our remote access security implementation:

| **Security Measure** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Remote Access Restriction** | No direct external access to lab resources. |
| **Jump Box Enforcement** | Access restricted via Entra Private Access (EPA) & MFA. |
| **Unauthorized Device Detection** | Alerts generated for unapproved network devices. |

These measures ensure that all access to internal resources follows secure authentication and access control processes.

### **3.4 Policy Review & Continuous Improvement**

Network security requires ongoing review and improvement to address emerging threats and evolving requirements.

The following table outlines our approach to policy review and improvement:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Security Policy Review** | Policies reviewed on a **monthly basis**. |
| **Log Analysis & Incident Response** | Logs analyzed for security trends and misconfigurations. |
| **Compliance Monitoring** | Regular audits ensure compliance with CIS benchmarks. |

This continuous improvement process ensures that network monitoring and defense mechanisms remain effective against evolving threats.

## üìä **4. Compliance Evidence**

Maintaining evidence of control implementation is essential for demonstrating compliance and ensuring continued effectiveness. Our documentation provides comprehensive coverage of each sub-control's implementation.

The following table maps CIS Control 13 sub-controls to our implementation documentation:

| **Control** | **Implementation Details** | **Reference Document** |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **13.1** | Real-time network traffic monitoring and logging. | [CISv8 13.1 Implementation](./13.1.md) |
| **13.2** | Enforced VLAN segmentation and firewall policies. | [CISv8 13.2 Implementation](./13.2.md) |
| **13.3** | Restricted remote access and secure jump box policies. | [CISv8 13.3 Implementation](./13.3.md) |
| **13.4** | Continuous security review and compliance audits. | [CISv8 13.4 Compliance](./13.4.md) |

This structured documentation approach ensures that all aspects of the control are properly addressed and verified through regular assessment.
