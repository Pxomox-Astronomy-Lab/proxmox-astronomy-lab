# **ðŸ“œ README - CIS Control 17: Incident Response**

## **1. Introduction**

Incident response ensures that **security incidents, unauthorized access, operational failures, and external threats** are handled **efficiently and with minimal business disruption**. **CIS Control 17** mandates structured procedures for **detecting, reporting, and mitigating incidents** to prevent security breaches and maintain system integrity.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** employs **a structured incident response process** with **real-time monitoring, reporting, containment, and recovery** to ensure compliance with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

| **Key Incident Response Features** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Incident Management Leadership** | Incidents are managed by the **Lead Engineer** and **Lab Owner**. |
| **Incident Reporting Methods** | Users report incidents via **Zammad Helpdesk, MS Teams, or phone**. |
| **Cloud & Infrastructure Compliance** | Azure & AWS compliance portals provide monitoring & documentation. |
| **Immediate Threat Mitigation** | Entra ID integration for **identity-based response** and credential revocation. |
| **Periodic Incident Review** | Security incidents **reviewed monthly** to improve response processes. |

## **3. Incident Response Implementation**

### **Incident Reporting & Detection**

All security incidents must be **promptly reported and investigated**.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Primary Reporting Method** | **Zammad Helpdesk (helpdesk.beardinthe.cloud)** for incident tracking. |
| **Alternative Reporting** | MS Teams or direct phone call for urgent incidents. |
| **Incident Escalation** | High-severity incidents reported **immediately to the Lead Engineer**. |

### **Incident Containment & Mitigation**

To minimize security risks, **incidents must be quickly contained and mitigated**.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Containment & Isolation** | Infected systems quarantined as per protocol. |
| **Incident Logging** | Actions recorded in **Zammad ticketing system**. |
| **Immediate Threat Response** | Entra ID used for real-time access revocation. |

### **Incident Resolution & Recovery**

All incidents must be **documented, analyzed, and resolved systematically**.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Resolution Plan** | Incident response team coordinates remediation. |
| **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** | Conducted for all high-severity incidents. |
| **System Recovery Validation** | Ensures impacted systems are **fully restored**. |

### **Incident Review & Continuous Improvement**

Security incidents must be **reviewed regularly to improve future responses**.

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Monthly Incident Review** | Reports analyzed for trends and response improvements. |
| **Lessons Learned Documentation** | Findings documented for internal training. |
| **Policy Adjustments** | Incident response policies updated based on threat analysis. |
