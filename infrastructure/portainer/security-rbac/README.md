# 🚢 **Portainer Enterprise Container Management**

Unified web-based management platform providing comprehensive orchestration capabilities for both Docker containers and RKE2 Kubernetes workloads within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab's hybrid infrastructure. Portainer serves as the central control plane for containerized services supporting astronomical research computing across our 7-node cluster.

## **Overview**

Portainer represents the enterprise-grade container management layer of our hybrid infrastructure architecture, providing intuitive web-based administration for both traditional Docker environments and modern Kubernetes orchestration. This unified platform enables efficient management of containerized astronomical computing workloads while maintaining the operational simplicity required for research computing environments.

The Portainer implementation bridges the gap between Docker's simplicity for single-node services and Kubernetes' sophistication for distributed computing, ensuring research teams can leverage appropriate containerization strategies without requiring deep container orchestration expertise. This approach supports rapid development iteration while maintaining production-grade reliability for critical astronomical data processing pipelines.

## **🏗️ Enterprise Architecture**

### **Hybrid Orchestration Strategy**

Portainer enables our hybrid container orchestration approach across the 7-node Proxmox cluster:

**Docker Management Layer:**

- **mgmt-docker01** - Primary Docker environment for infrastructure services
- **proj-dev01** - Development and testing container environments
- **proj-dp01** - Data processing and ETL container workloads

**Kubernetes Management Layer:**

- **proj-k8s01, proj-k8s02, proj-k8s03** - 3-node RKE2 cluster for distributed computing
- **96GB total RAM, 48 vCPU** - Dedicated resources for ML/AI and scalable workloads

### **Production Workloads**
