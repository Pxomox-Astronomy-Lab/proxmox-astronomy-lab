# **📡 Security Monitoring & Threat Detection**  

## **📜 Overview**  

The **Security Monitoring** section documents the **real-time monitoring, alerting, and threat detection** strategies used in the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.  

This ensures **continuous security visibility** across all infrastructure components, including **Proxmox, Kubernetes, cloud services (Azure, AWS), and network assets**.  

Proactive security monitoring allows for **early detection of security threats, unauthorized access, and anomalous activity**, helping maintain **a strong security posture**.
