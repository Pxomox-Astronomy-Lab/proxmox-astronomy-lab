# üö® **CISv8-17 Incident Response Policy**

## üéØ **1. Purpose**

This policy establishes the framework for responding to security incidents within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. Through structured detection, reporting, and mitigation procedures, we ensure that security events are addressed effectively while minimizing operational disruption.

Incident response ensures that **security incidents, unauthorized access, operational failures, and external threats** are handled **efficiently and with minimal business disruption**. This policy defines **structured procedures for reporting, managing, and resolving incidents** within the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

---

## üî≠ **2. Scope**

This policy governs all aspects of security incident management across the lab environment, establishing clear requirements for detection, reporting, containment, and resolution.

This policy applies to **all IT assets, network infrastructure, and cloud services**, as well as:

- **Internal and public-facing services**
- **Cloud-based environments (Azure, AWS)**
- **Critical lab infrastructure**

### **2.1 Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **structured incident response** through multiple complementary mechanisms that work together to provide effective incident management:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Incident Management Leadership** | Incidents are managed by the **Lead Engineer** and **Lab Owner**. |
| **Incident Reporting Methods** | Users report incidents via **Zammad Helpdesk, MS Teams, or phone (in order of priority)**. |
| **Incident Response Planning** | Defined **onboarding and offboarding policies** for security events. |
| **Cloud & Infrastructure Compliance** | **Azure & AWS compliance portals** provide extensive monitoring & documentation. |
| **Secure Incident Handling** | Entra ID integration for **identity-based incident response**. |
| **Periodic Incident Review** | Security incidents **reviewed monthly** to improve processes. |

This integrated approach ensures comprehensive coverage of the incident response lifecycle, from initial detection through resolution and continuous improvement.

---

## üë• **3. Responsibilities**

Effective incident response requires clear role definition and accountability across the organization. Each role has specific responsibilities that contribute to our overall incident management capabilities.

The following table outlines the primary responsibilities for implementing and maintaining our incident response program:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Lead Engineer (Incident Manager)** | Oversees incident response, assigns tasks, and ensures resolution. |
| **Lab Owner (Business Impact Lead)** | Assesses the impact of incidents and directs mitigation efforts. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Investigate, document, and resolve incidents using defined response processes. |
| **Users** | Report security incidents via Zammad, MS Teams, or phone (based on urgency). |

This clear delineation of responsibilities ensures that incident response remains a priority at all levels of the organization with appropriate oversight and execution.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Incident Response Planning & Documentation**

A comprehensive incident response plan forms the foundation of effective security incident management. This documentation must be regularly maintained and accessible to all relevant personnel.

The following table outlines our incident response planning requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Incident Response Plan** | Defined **incident handling, containment, and resolution procedures**. |
| **Security Incident Notification** | All security incidents reported via **Zammad Helpdesk, MS Teams, or escalation phone call**. |
| **Compliance Documentation** | Azure & AWS compliance portals provide evidence for audit trails. |

This documentation ensures that incident response activities follow a consistent, structured approach while maintaining appropriate compliance evidence.

---

### **4.2 Incident Detection & Reporting**

Timely detection and reporting are critical to effective incident response. Our approach provides multiple reporting channels while ensuring appropriate prioritization.

The following table outlines our incident detection and reporting requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Primary Reporting Method** | **Zammad Helpdesk (helpdesk.beardinthe.cloud)** as the primary incident tracker. |
| **Alternative Reporting Methods** | MS Teams chat or direct phone call for urgent cases. |
| **Incident Escalation Process** | High-severity incidents reported **immediately to the Lead Engineer**. |

These reporting channels ensure that security incidents are promptly identified and tracked throughout the resolution process.

---

### **4.3 Incident Containment & Mitigation**

Once detected, incidents must be contained to prevent further damage. Our approach provides a structured containment methodology appropriate to the incident severity.

The following table outlines our containment and mitigation requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Containment & Isolation** | Infected or compromised systems quarantined as per protocol. |
| **Incident Response Logging** | Actions recorded in **Zammad ticketing system** for review. |
| **Immediate Threat Mitigation** | Entra ID used for immediate revocation of credentials. |

These containment measures ensure that security incidents are promptly addressed to minimize potential impact.

---

### **4.4 Incident Resolution & Recovery**

Following containment, incidents must be fully resolved and affected systems restored to normal operation. Our approach ensures thorough remediation and validation.

The following table outlines our resolution and recovery requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Resolution Plan** | Incident response team coordinates full remediation. |
| **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** | Conducted for all high-severity incidents. |
| **System Recovery Validation** | Ensures impacted systems are **fully restored and operational**. |

This structured approach ensures that incidents are completely resolved while identifying and addressing underlying causes.

---

### **4.5 Incident Review & Continuous Improvement**

Regular review of security incidents enables ongoing improvement of our incident response capabilities. Our approach incorporates lessons learned into process refinements.

The following table outlines our review and improvement requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Monthly Incident Review** | Incident reports analyzed for **patterns & improvements**. |
| **Lessons Learned Documentation** | Findings documented for future training. |
| **Security Policy Updates** | Processes adjusted based on new threats. |

This continuous improvement cycle ensures that our incident response capabilities remain effective against evolving threats.

---

## üö´ **5. Exception Handling**

In certain scenarios, exceptions to this policy may be required. All exceptions must follow a structured review and approval process to ensure security risks are properly managed.

Exceptions to this policy must be **requested in writing** and include:

- **Justification for the request**
- **Risk assessment of non-compliance**
- **Proposed alternative mitigations**
- **Technical challenges preventing compliance**
- **Planned review date for reevaluation**

This structured approach ensures that any policy exceptions are properly documented and regularly reevaluated.

---

## üîí **6. Enforcement & Non-Compliance**

Enforcement mechanisms are essential for ensuring policy compliance. When violations are detected, a structured response process will be followed.

Failure to comply with this policy may result in:

- Restricted access to lab resources
- Escalation to security teams for investigation
- Required remedial actions to restore compliance

These enforcement measures ensure that policy violations are addressed promptly and appropriately.
