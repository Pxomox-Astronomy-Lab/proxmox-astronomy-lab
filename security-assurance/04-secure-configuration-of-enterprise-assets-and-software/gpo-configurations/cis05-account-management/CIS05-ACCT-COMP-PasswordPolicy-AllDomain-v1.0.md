# 🔐 **CIS05-ACCT-COMP-PasswordPolicy-AllDomain-v1.0**

This Group Policy Object implements comprehensive password policy enforcement for all domain and local accounts within the Windows Server 2025 Active Directory environment. The GPO establishes systematic password security baseline requirements through domain-wide policy enforcement, ensuring consistent credential strength and lifecycle management across all domain-joined systems through centralized Group Policy distribution and automated password security validation.

The policy configuration implements CIS Control 5 (Account and Credential Management) requirements by establishing strong password complexity, appropriate lifecycle management, and secure storage mechanisms to protect against credential-based attacks and unauthorized access attempts across the enterprise domain infrastructure.

## **3.3 Implementation Standards**

This subsection establishes technical standards for password policy deployment and enterprise credential security management.

Password policy implementation follows systematic deployment standards and operational procedures:

- **Deployment Method**: Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) with domain-wide linking
- **Target Scope**: All domain-joined computers and user accounts
- **Testing Protocol**: Controlled implementation through test organizational units before production deployment
- **Compliance Validation**: Automated Group Policy Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) reporting
- **Documentation Standard**: Complete configuration mapping with CIS control references and security justification

# 🔗 **4. Implementation & Usage**

This section provides systematic guidance for implementing password policy configuration and establishing credential security compliance across domain infrastructure.

## **4.1 Prerequisites**

This subsection identifies requirements for successful password policy implementation within Active Directory domain infrastructure.

Password policy implementation requires enterprise domain infrastructure with appropriate administrative access and comprehensive testing capabilities:

- **Domain Infrastructure**: Windows Server 2025 Active Directory domain services with Group Policy Management Console access
- **Administrative Access**: Domain Admin or equivalent Group Policy management permissions for password policy configuration
- **Testing Environment**: Isolated organizational units for controlled policy testing and user impact validation
- **Monitoring Capability**: Security monitoring infrastructure to validate policy application and compliance effectiveness
- **User Communication**: Change management procedures for password requirement updates and user education

## **4.2 Monitoring**

This subsection establishes monitoring requirements for password policy effectiveness and compliance validation across domain infrastructure.

Password policy monitoring leverages the centralized monitoring stack on proj-mon01 (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, AlertManager, Grafana Alloy) for systematic credential security tracking and policy compliance validation. The monitoring philosophy of "if it can be collected, we do" applies to password policy compliance status, credential security events, and policy enforcement effectiveness measurement through centralized security monitoring infrastructure.

Monitoring includes password policy application validation, credential security event tracking, and user compliance measurement through comprehensive security event analysis and policy effectiveness reporting.

# 🔐 **6. Security & Compliance**

This section establishes security framework alignment and compliance requirements for password policy configuration within enterprise credential security architecture.

## **6.1 Security Framework Alignment**

This subsection maps password policy configuration to enterprise security frameworks and compliance requirements for systematic credential protection.

**Security Disclaimer**: The password policy configuration documented in this guide represents a credential security baseline establishment for Windows Server 2025 Active Directory infrastructure. These configurations should be thoroughly tested in non-production environments before deployment. While these templates follow CIS Controls v8 credential security framework guidelines, organizations should validate policy compatibility with their specific user experience requirements and business operational needs. The security research computing team maintains these configurations as implementation guidance rather than production security recommendations, and encourages consultation with dedicated security professionals for enterprise deployment validation.

### **Framework Mapping**

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** | **Implementation Evidence** |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **CIS Controls v8** | Control 5: Account and Credential Management | Complete password policy configuration implementing credential security baseline requirements |

Password policy configuration enables systematic compliance evidence collection through Group Policy Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) reporting and credential security validation. Compliance validation requires regular policy application assessment and password strength monitoring to maintain baseline credential security posture across domain infrastructure components.

# 📋 **7. Backup & Recovery**

This section establishes protection and recovery procedures for password policy configuration and credential security baseline preservation.

## **7.1 Protection Strategy**

This subsection defines systematic protection requirements for password policy configuration and credential security baseline preservation.

Password policy configuration requires multi-tier protection strategy encompassing Group Policy backup, version control, and policy baseline preservation to ensure rapid credential security recovery and systematic policy restoration capabilities.

### **Protection Tiers**

| **Tier** | **Scope** | **Method** | **Frequency** |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Tier 1** | GPO Backup | Group Policy Management Console backup | Daily automatic |
| **Tier 2** | Configuration Export | PowerShell GPO export and documentation | Weekly |
