# ü§ù **CISv8-15 Service Provider Management Policy**

## üîç **1. Overview**

This policy establishes the framework for managing third-party service providers that support the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. Through structured inventory, assessment, and monitoring processes, we ensure that all vendors and service providers maintain appropriate security controls and comply with our requirements.

### **1.1 Why This Policy Matters**

Service providers, including **cloud platforms, software vendors, and external service providers**, play a critical role in enterprise operations. Proper management of these providers ensures that **enterprise data is protected, compliance is maintained, and service continuity is assured**. This policy establishes a **structured approach to inventory, classification, monitoring, and decommissioning** of third-party service providers for the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

### **1.2 Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **secure service provider management** through multiple complementary mechanisms that work together to provide comprehensive oversight:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Service Provider Inventory** | Maintained through **Snipe-IT**, with vendors, applications, and services classified. |
| **Defined Onboarding & Offboarding** | Onboarding and decommissioning policies documented and tracked. |
| **Primary Cloud Providers** | **Azure is the primary provider**, with some AWS usage, both known for extensive compliance frameworks. |
| **Annual Review & Compliance Tracking** | Service provider relationships reviewed annually. |

This structured approach ensures visibility into all service provider relationships while maintaining appropriate security controls throughout the service lifecycle.

## üìä **2. Compliance Mapping**

Our service provider management strategy aligns with multiple industry frameworks to ensure comprehensive coverage and best practices implementation. These mappings help demonstrate our security posture to stakeholders and ensure regulatory compliance.

The following table shows how this policy maps to established security frameworks:

| **Framework** | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **CISv8** | CIS Control 15 ‚Äì Service Provider Management |
| **NIST 800-53** | SA-9 ‚Äì External System Services |
| **ISO 27001** | A.15 ‚Äì Supplier Relationships |

By aligning with these frameworks, we ensure our service provider management practices meet industry standards while providing appropriate oversight for our environment.

## üë• **3. Responsibilities**

Effective service provider management requires clear role definition and accountability across the organization. Each role has specific responsibilities that contribute to our overall security posture.

The following table outlines the primary responsibilities for implementing and maintaining our service provider management program:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Maintain service provider inventory, review compliance documents, and ensure secure configurations. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Ensure vendors follow proper onboarding/offboarding processes and maintain compliance records. |
| **Business Unit Owners** | Ensure that service providers align with enterprise security and regulatory requirements. |

This clear delineation of responsibilities ensures that service provider management remains a priority at all levels of the organization with appropriate oversight and execution.

## üìù **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Service Provider Inventory & Classification**

Maintaining an accurate inventory of all service providers is essential for effective security management. This inventory must include appropriate classification and risk assessment information.

The following table outlines our service provider inventory requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Inventory Management** | All service providers tracked in **Snipe-IT**. |
| **Service Provider Classifications** | Vendors, Applications, and Services categorized. |
| **Compliance & Security Review** | Service providers evaluated for compliance risks. |

This structured inventory provides visibility into all service provider relationships and forms the foundation for our security assessment and monitoring activities.

---

### **4.2 Service Provider Compliance & Security Reviews**

All service providers must meet our security and compliance requirements to protect sensitive data and maintain regulatory compliance.

The following table outlines our compliance and security review requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Primary Cloud Providers** | **Azure (primary) and AWS (limited use)**, both with extensive compliance frameworks. |
| **Compliance Documentation** | Service provider security and compliance certifications reviewed annually. |
| **Access Control & Security Policies** | Providers must support MFA, encryption, and logging. |

These compliance assessments ensure that service providers maintain appropriate security controls throughout the relationship lifecycle.

---

### **4.3 Service Provider Onboarding & Offboarding**

Structured processes for both onboarding and decommissioning service providers are essential for maintaining security throughout the service lifecycle.

The following table outlines our onboarding and offboarding requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Onboarding Policies** | New vendors reviewed for security, compliance, and business needs. |
| **Contractual Agreements** | Security expectations outlined in contracts. |
| **Offboarding & Decommissioning** | Service providers removed securely, ensuring no residual access to enterprise data. |

These structured processes ensure that security is maintained from the initial engagement through the end of the service relationship.

---

### **4.4 Monitoring & Ongoing Verification**

Continuous monitoring of service provider security is essential to ensure ongoing compliance with our requirements.

The following table outlines our monitoring and verification approach:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Annual Compliance Review** | All providers reviewed for security and performance. |
| **Service Monitoring** | Logging and alerting via **Azure, Loki, and other security tools**. |
| **Vendor Risk Assessment** | Service providers evaluated for changes in security posture. |

This ongoing monitoring ensures that security issues are promptly identified and addressed throughout the service relationship.

---

### **4.5 Restricting Unauthorized Service Providers**

To maintain a secure environment, we must ensure that only approved service providers are used for enterprise data and operations.

The following table outlines our approach to unauthorized service providers:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Unauthorized Provider Policy** | Users prohibited from storing enterprise data on unapproved platforms. |
| **Access Controls & Logging** | Enterprise security policies applied to all service provider access points. |
| **Review & Enforcement** | Non-compliant vendors flagged for review and decommissioning. |

These controls prevent the proliferation of unauthorized service providers that could introduce security risks to the environment.
