# **ðŸ“œ README - CIS Control 14: Security Awareness Training**

## **1. Introduction**

Security awareness training ensures that **all employees, contractors, and users understand cybersecurity risks and best practices** to protect enterprise assets. **CIS Control 14** mandates structured **training programs, phishing simulations, and continuous updates** to enhance security culture.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** employs a **comprehensive security training strategy** to ensure compliance with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

| **Key Security Awareness Features** | **Implementation** |
|------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Onboarding Security Training** | All new users must complete cybersecurity training before gaining system access. |
| **Annual Cybersecurity Training** | Users complete **mandatory annual training** on best security practices. |
| **Phishing Simulations** | Microsoft Defender Security Awareness Training, plus third-party training as needed. |
| **Incident Reporting Training** | Users are trained to recognize and report security threats. |
| **Compliance Tracking & Remediation** | Training completion monitored, additional training assigned if needed. |
