# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-10 Malware Defense Policy Template**

## **1. Overview**  

### **Why This Policy Matters**  

Malware defense is essential for **protecting enterprise assets from malicious software, including viruses, ransomware, trojans, and rootkits**. This policy defines **how organizations can configure, update, detect, and remediate malware threats across all managed systems**.

### **Key Aspects of This Policy:**  

âœ… **Ensures anti-malware software is installed, maintained, and updated.**  
âœ… **Defines automated processes for malware detection and remediation.**  
âœ… **Requires system-wide security features, such as memory protections and execution controls.**  
âœ… **Supports compliance with regulatory frameworks by enforcing security best practices.**  

This document **presents the CISv8 Malware Defense Policy Template** and includes **additional information on how organizations may implement it**, along with a **generalized example of its application in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

## **3. CISv8 Malware Defense Policy Template**  

```markdown
# Malware Defense Policy Template  

## **Purpose**  
Malware defense includes the **configuration, maintenance, detection, reporting, and remediation** of anti-malware software and the malware it identifies. The Malware Defense Policy provides the **processes and procedures to ensure continuous security and protection against malicious software**.  

---

## **Responsibility**  
- **IT is responsible** for installing, maintaining, and enforcing anti-malware defenses.  
- **Administrators must configure** all enterprise assets to support malware detection and prevention.  
- **Users are responsible** for ensuring their enterprise-connected devices remain updated, follow security policies, and do not introduce unauthorized software.  

---

## **Exceptions**  
Exceptions to this policy may be requested in writing and must include:  
- The reason for the request,  
- Risk to the enterprise of not following the written policy,  
- Specific mitigations that will not be implemented,  
- Technical and other difficulties, and  
- Date of review.  

---

## **Policy**  

### **4.1 Malware Protection Configuration**  
1. **IT must install and maintain anti-malware software on all enterprise-managed assets** where applicable.  
   - **Users must not disable anti-malware protections**.  
   - **Users must not modify security update settings** without IT approval.  

---

### **4.2 Automated Updates & Patch Management**  
1. **Anti-malware software must be configured to update automatically**.  
2. **All security patches must be applied automatically** unless an alternative update policy is approved.  
3. **Operating systems must be configured to auto-update**, unless managed through an enterprise patching strategy.  

---

### **4.3 Malware Detection & Logging**  
1. **Anti-malware software must be configured to detect and report malware activity**.  
2. **All high-severity malware alerts must be investigated and remediated immediately**.  
3. **Detection events must be logged, with logs retained according to enterprise policies**.  

---

### **4.4 Remediation & Response**  
1. **Identified malware must be immediately quarantined or removed** from affected assets.  
2. **Any unauthorized software must be removed or approved through an exception process**.  
3. **Exceptions must be documented in the software inventory and security exception register**.  

---

### **4.5 Security Monitoring & Threat Intelligence**  
1. **Malware detection logs must be collected and analyzed for potential security threats**.  
2. **Security teams must monitor for emerging threats and ensure defenses are adjusted accordingly**.  
3. **Forensic analysis must be performed for any major malware incidents**.  

```

## **4. Best Practices for Implementing This Policy**  

Organizations implementing **CIS Control 10 â€“ Malware Defense** should consider the following best practices:  

- **Deploy Multi-Layered Protection** â€“ Use **endpoint security, application controls, and network-level threat detection**.  
- **Automate Malware Updates** â€“ Ensure **daily updates for malware signatures** and **automated OS patching**.  
- **Implement Execution Restrictions** â€“ Use **AppArmor (Linux) or Group Policy (Windows) to block unauthorized software execution**.  
- **Monitor and Log All Malware Events** â€“ Integrate **malware alerts with SIEM systems** for real-time security monitoring.  
- **Educate Users on Security Risks** â€“ Enforce **security awareness training** on identifying **phishing attempts and malicious downloads**.  

These strategies ensure a **structured, automated, and proactive approach** to malware defense.

## **5. Example Implementation in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**  

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, CIS Control 10 is implemented with the following measures:  

### **5.1 Endpoint Protection & Malware Defense**  

âœ… **Windows systems use Windows Defender and Wazuh for continuous monitoring.**  
âœ… **Linux systems use Chkrootkit, RKHunter, and Wazuh Agent for security scans.**  
âœ… **Execution control via AppArmor and Intune prevents unauthorized applications from running.**  

### **5.2 Automated Updates & Patch Management**  

âœ… **Windows updates are managed through Windows Update and Win-Get.**  
âœ… **Linux updates are enforced via Ansible, apt-get, and DNF.**  
âœ… **All anti-malware software is configured for daily automatic signature updates.**  

### **5.3 Threat Intelligence & Log Monitoring**  

âœ… **Malware alerts are forwarded to Wazuh SIEM for security review.**  
âœ… **Anomaly detection flags unauthorized software installations for investigation.**  
âœ… **Security events are logged and retained for a minimum of 90 days.**

## **6. Summary and Next Steps**  

âœ… **This document presents the official CISv8 Malware Defense Policy Template.**  
âœ… **It includes additional information on possible solutions for implementation.**  
âœ… **A high-level example from the Proxmox Astronomy Lab is provided for reference.**  

ðŸ“Œ **Actionable Next Steps:**  

- **Ensure all enterprise systems have anti-malware protection installed and enforced.**  
- **Automate signature and OS updates to reduce security vulnerabilities.**  
- **Centralize malware logging for continuous monitoring and security response.**  

ðŸš€ **By following this framework, organizations can ensure structured, secure, and auditable malware defense.**
