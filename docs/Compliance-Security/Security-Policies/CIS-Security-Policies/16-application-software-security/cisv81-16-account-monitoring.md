# üîê **CISv8-16 Application Security & Software Integrity Policy**

## üéØ **1. Purpose**

This policy establishes the framework for secure software development and deployment across the Proxmox Astronomy Lab environment. By implementing structured security controls throughout the software lifecycle, we protect the integrity of our applications while ensuring they meet security and compliance requirements.

Ensuring **secure software development and deployment** is critical for **maintaining the integrity, security, and reliability of applications**. This policy defines **application security best practices, integrity verification processes, and secure deployment standards** for all internally and publicly released software within the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

---

## üî≠ **2. Scope**

This policy governs all aspects of software development and deployment across the lab environment, establishing clear requirements for security controls throughout the application lifecycle.

This policy applies to **all software development, containerized workloads, and infrastructure deployments**, covering:

- **Internal tools and scripts**
- **Publicly released code (e.g., GitHub repositories)**
- **Containerized applications and Kubernetes workloads**
- **Database and infrastructure components**

### **2.1 Key Objectives**

This policy enforces **secure application development and deployment** through multiple complementary mechanisms that work together to provide defense-in-depth:

| **Objective** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Secure Software Development** | Applications follow secure coding guidelines and CIS-compliant configurations. |
| **Open Source Contributions** | Public releases on **GitHub**, with issue tracking and pull request acceptance. |
| **Artifact & Dependency Security** | Software components managed in **Snipe-IT and Azure Container Registry (ACR)**. |
| **Trusted Libraries & Dependencies** | Only well-known and vetted libraries used (e.g., **NASA Astronomy Libraries, Astropy**). |
| **Secure Deployment Pipelines** | Secure **Docker configurations, Helm charts, RKE2 Kubernetes deployment**. |
| **Development Isolation** | Dev workloads deployed in **a dedicated namespace on the K8s cluster**. |
| **Code Scanning & Security Audits** | GitHub **code scanning** enabled for **proxmox-astronomy-lab repo**. |

This integrated approach ensures that security is built into our software throughout its lifecycle, from initial development through deployment and maintenance.

---

## üë• **3. Responsibilities**

Effective application security requires clear role definition and accountability across the organization. Each role has specific responsibilities that contribute to our overall security posture.

The following table outlines the primary responsibilities for implementing and maintaining our application security program:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Infrastructure Engineers (L2/L3)** | Secure CI/CD pipelines, manage container security, and monitor application compliance. |
| **Developers** | Follow secure coding guidelines, ensure dependency security, and conduct code reviews. |
| **Administrators (L1/L2-Lite)** | Monitor infrastructure security and enforce software integrity policies. |

This clear delineation of responsibilities ensures that application security remains a priority at all levels of the organization with appropriate oversight and execution.

---

## üíª **4. Policy Implementation**

### **4.1 Secure Software Development & Release Management**

Secure software development follows a structured approach that integrates security throughout the development lifecycle. Our implementation ensures that security is considered from initial design through deployment.

The following table outlines our secure development and release requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Internal Development Baseline** | Established, in active development, no public GitHub releases yet. |
| **Public Releases** | All external-facing code hosted on **GitHub**, open to issues and pull requests. |
| **Version Control & Audits** | All configuration changes managed via **Git** for tracking and auditing. |

This structured approach provides visibility into the development process while ensuring appropriate security controls are maintained.

---

### **4.2 Artifact & Dependency Security**

Software components and dependencies represent significant security considerations that must be carefully managed throughout the application lifecycle.

The following table outlines our artifact and dependency security requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Software Inventory Management** | **Snipe-IT** tracks vendors, applications, and services. |
| **Container Registry & SBOMs** | **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** manages containers, with built-in security scanning. |
| **Dependency Security** | Well-known, vetted libraries used (e.g., **Astropy, NASA Astronomy Libraries**). |

This comprehensive approach ensures that all software components are properly tracked, vetted, and secured throughout their lifecycle.

---

### **4.3 Secure Deployment & Infrastructure Protection**

Deployment and infrastructure security are essential components of our defense-in-depth strategy. Our approach ensures that deployed applications maintain appropriate security controls in production environments.

The following table outlines our deployment and infrastructure security requirements:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Secure Containers & Infrastructure** | Hardened **Docker configurations, Helm charts, and RKE2 Kubernetes** deployments. |
| **Data Security Standards** | **Database TLS connections, encryption at rest**. |
| **Development Environment Isolation** | **Dedicated K8s dev namespace** for testing before deployment. |

These security measures ensure that applications remain protected throughout the deployment process and during production operations.

---

### **4.4 Secure Development Practices for Small Teams**

Our lab environment operates with small development teams that require efficient, streamlined security practices that maintain effectiveness without excessive overhead.

The following table outlines our approach to secure development for small teams:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Lightweight CI/CD Pipelines** | GitHub Actions for code builds and security testing. |
| **Static Code Analysis** | Automated security checks using **GitHub Code Scanning**. |
| **Manual Code Reviews** | Required for critical security-related updates. |

This balanced approach ensures appropriate security controls while maintaining development efficiency for small teams.

---

### **4.5 Application Security & External Reporting**

External facing applications and public code repositories require additional security considerations to manage potential exposure and community interaction.

The following table outlines our approach to external security and reporting:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Public API & Code Exposure** | Any released API hosted on **dedicated remote infrastructure**. |
| **Research & Astronomy Lab Code** | Publicly released, but assumed to run **internally within research labs**. |
| **Open Security Reporting** | Security vulnerabilities in public repositories **can be reported by external users**. |

These measures ensure appropriate security for public-facing code while maintaining channels for community security feedback.

---

### **4.6 Secure Authentication & Access Controls**

Authentication and access controls are fundamental security components that must be consistently implemented across all applications.
