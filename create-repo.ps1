# Proxmox Astronomy Lab

## A Scalable, AI-Enhanced Research Infrastructure for Radio Astronomy and Scientific Computing

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** is a **high-performance research environment** designed for **Hydrogen Line Radio Astronomy, AI-driven SDR signal processing, and secure, remote collaboration**. The lab combines **Proxmox, Kubernetes, AI/ML, and modern IT automation** to create a **reproducible, scalable** research platform.

## ðŸ”¬ The Simulation Approach

The Proxmox Astronomy Lab is unique in its approach: we're deliberately **simulating enterprise-grade IT practices in a citizen science environment**. While most home labs focus solely on functionality, we've implemented a comprehensive security framework meeting CISv8 standards, enforcing proper change management, and maintaining documentation that would normally be found in corporate environments.

This approach serves multiple purposes:
- **Educational value** for those looking to learn enterprise IT practices
- **Practical demonstrations** of security implementations at scale
- **Real-world validation** of compliance frameworks in non-enterprise settings
- **Transferable skills** development for contributors

Read more about our simulation philosophy in [docs/simulation-approach](docs/simulation-approach).
