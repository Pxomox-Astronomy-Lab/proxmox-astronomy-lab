# üóÑÔ∏è **2. Storage Platforms**

This section outlines the core storage technologies deployed in the lab environment for different storage requirements and access patterns.

## **2.1 Object Storage**

This subsection documents the S3-compatible object storage platform used for unstructured data and scalable research storage.

| **Component** | **Function** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **MinIO** | S3-compatible object storage | [MinIO Server](MinIO/MinIO-Server.md) |

MinIO provides a scalable, S3-compatible object storage platform for research datasets, application artifacts, and large unstructured data, with robust security and access control capabilities.

## **2.2 File Sharing**

This subsection covers the collaborative file sharing platform used for user data and shared documents.

| **Component** | **Function** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Nextcloud** | File sharing and collaboration | [Nextcloud Server](Nextcloud/Nextcloud-Server.md) |

Nextcloud enables secure file sharing, document collaboration, and user-friendly access to shared research assets, integrating with lab identity management for access control.

## **2.3 Backup Systems**

This subsection documents the backup solution used to protect critical data across the lab environment.

| **Component** | **Function** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Restic** | Backup management | [Backup Strategy](Restic/Backup-Strategy.md) |

Restic provides efficient, secure backups with deduplication, encryption, and versatile target support, protecting critical data across the lab environment.

# üèóÔ∏è **3. Technical Architecture**

This section details the technical implementation of the storage infrastructure, including deployment patterns, hardware configurations, and integration points.

## **3.1 Storage Architecture**

This subsection explains how storage systems are deployed and managed within the lab environment.

| **Component** | **Deployment Method** | **Host System** |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **MinIO** | Docker container | lab-apps01 |
| **Nextcloud** | Docker container | proj-apps01 |
| **Restic** | System service | Multiple hosts |

The storage architecture leverages containerization for isolation and manageability, deploying services on appropriate hosts based on access patterns and resource requirements.

## **3.2 Storage Tiers**

This subsection details the tiered storage approach implemented across the lab environment.

| **Storage Tier** | **Technology** | **Use Case** |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Hot Storage** | Local NVMe | Active datasets, high-performance needs |
| **Warm Storage** | SAS/SATA SSD | General file storage, application data |
| **Cold Storage** | HDD Arrays | Archive data, backups, long-term retention |

The tiered storage approach optimizes performance and cost by placing data on appropriate storage media based on access patterns and performance requirements.

# üîê **5. Security & Compliance**

This section documents how security controls are implemented and how compliance requirements are met for storage systems.

## **5.1 Access Control**

This subsection documents the access management approach for storage systems.

| **Control Type** | **Implementation** | **Verification Method** |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Authentication** | Integration with Zitadel | Authentication logs |
| **Authorization** | Role-based access + ACLs | Permission audit |
| **Encryption** | TLS for transport, at-rest encryption | Configuration verification |

The access control mechanisms ensure appropriate authorization for all storage interactions while maintaining comprehensive audit capabilities.

## **5.2 Data Protection**

This subsection covers how data is protected within storage systems throughout its lifecycle.

| **Protection Mechanism** | **Implementation** | **Data Types Protected** |
|--------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Backup Protection** | Encrypted, versioned backups | All critical data |
| **Retention Policies** | Age-based, automated policies | Research data, backups |
| **Immutability** | Object locking for critical data | Baseline research datasets |

These data protection mechanisms ensure appropriate safeguards for research and operational data through encryption, backup, and retention controls.
