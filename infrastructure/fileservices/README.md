# 📁 **File Services Infrastructure**

Enterprise file storage, sharing, and management services providing distributed file access, collaboration capabilities, and centralized data management for astronomical research within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab's hybrid infrastructure. This directory encompasses distributed file systems, network-attached storage, and collaborative file management solutions.

## **Overview**

File services infrastructure provides the critical distributed file access layer enabling seamless data sharing and collaboration across our hybrid computing environment. Our enterprise-grade file services support diverse access patterns required by astronomical research, from high-performance distributed computing file access to collaborative research data sharing and long-term data archival.

The file services architecture integrates with both VM-based applications and Kubernetes persistent storage, providing consistent file access patterns while supporting diverse protocols and access methods required by different astronomical computing workloads. This approach ensures optimal performance and accessibility for research teams while maintaining enterprise-grade security and data governance standards.
