| Repository Storage | Dedicated volume for Git repositories | lab-apps01-git-volume |
| CI Runner | Actions Runner for automation | lab-apps01 |
| Web Proxy | Nginx SSL termination and routing | lab-apps01 |

### **3.3 Dependencies**

The following table outlines the dependencies and relationships between version control applications and other infrastructure components:

| **Dependency Type** | **Service/Component** | **Impact if Unavailable** |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Requires** | PostgreSQL Database | Repository metadata unavailable |
| **Requires** | Zitadel/Identity | Authentication failure |
| **Requires** | Nginx Proxy | Web access unavailable |
| **Requires** | Storage Backend | Repository access disrupted |
| **Required By** | CI/CD Pipelines | Automation workflows halted |
| **Required By** | Infrastructure as Code | Configuration management disrupted |

| Contributor | Commit access to specific repositories | Approved by Repository Owner |
| Reader | Read-only access to repositories | Self-registration with approval |
| Service Account | API/automation access | Approved by Git Administrator |

### **4.2 Repository Management**

The following table details the repository management policies:

| **Repository Type** | **Backup Frequency** | **Retention Policy** |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Infrastructure Code | Daily + commits | Indefinite |
