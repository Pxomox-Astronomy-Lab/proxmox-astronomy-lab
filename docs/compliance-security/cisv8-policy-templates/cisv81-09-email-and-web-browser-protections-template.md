# **ðŸ“œ CISv8-09 Secure Configuration Management Policy Template**

## **1. Overview**  

### **Why This Policy Matters**  

Secure configurations ensure that enterprise assets are **properly hardened, free from default credentials, unnecessary services, and insecure settings** that could introduce vulnerabilities. A **well-defined secure configuration management policy** ensures that **all systems, applications, and network devices** are **configured, monitored, and updated** in accordance with best security practices.

### **Key Aspects of This Policy:**  

âœ… **Enforces a baseline configuration for all enterprise systems and applications.**  
âœ… **Ensures configurations are monitored and deviations are flagged.**  
âœ… **Reduces the risk of security misconfigurations leading to data breaches.**  
âœ… **Supports compliance with CIS benchmarks and regulatory frameworks.**  

This document **presents the CISv8 Secure Configuration Management Policy Template** and includes **additional information on how organizations may implement it**, along with a **generalized example of its application in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**.

## **2. Compliance Mapping**  

| **Framework**      | **Control Mapping** |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **CIS Controls**   | CIS Control 9 â€“ Secure Configuration Management |
| **NIST 800-53**    | CM-6 â€“ Configuration Management |
| **ISO 27001**      | A.14.2 â€“ Security in Development & Maintenance |

## **3. CISv8 Secure Configuration Management Policy Template**  

```markdown
# Secure Configuration Management Policy Template  

## **Purpose**  
Secure configurations are used to remove default accounts, passwords, unnecessary services, and other functionality that ship with default configurations in products used by the enterprise. These default configurations may introduce weaknesses that are under the responsibility of the enterprise using the assets. Additionally, secure configurations sometimes enable security-relevant tools and settings that are not available by default. This Secure Configuration Management Policy provides the processes and procedures for identifying, applying, and maintaining secure configurations throughout the lifetime of all assets and services.

---

## **Responsibility**  
IT is responsible for all secure configurations. This information is relayed to other business units within the enterprise such as finance, accounting, and cybersecurity as required or needed. IT is responsible for informing all users of their responsibilities in the use of any assets assigned to them.

---

## **Exceptions**  
Exceptions to this policy may be requested in writing and must include:  
- The reason for the request,  
- Risk to the enterprise of not following the written policy,  
- Specific mitigations that will not be implemented,  
- Technical and other difficulties, and  
- Date of review.

---

## **Policy**  

### **4.1 Secure Configuration Planning & Selection**  
1. Configuration guidelines must be selected based on either **vendor-provided hardening requirements or industry standards** (e.g., CIS Benchmarksâ„¢, DISA STIGs).  
2. A **set of secure configurations must be selected before deployment** for:  
   - **Operating systems and applications**.  
   - **Cloud platforms or third-party services**.  
   - **Network appliances and security devices**.  
3. If no configuration standard exists, IT must research and develop a **custom security baseline** based on best practices.  

---

### **4.2 Secure Configuration Implementation**  
1. **All deployed systems must meet security hardening requirements**:  
   - **Automatic session expiration must be enforced** (15 min for desktops, 2 min for mobile).  
   - **Default-deny firewall rules must be applied** for all systems.  
   - **Default accounts and credentials must be disabled or renamed**.  
   - **Software must update automatically unless an alternative patching process exists**.  
2. **Network security configurations must include**:  
   - **Unnecessary ports, protocols, and services must be disabled**.  
   - **DNS filtering must be enabled to block access to malicious domains**.  
   - **TLS encryption must be enforced for all communications**.  

---

### **4.3 Secure Configuration Monitoring & Compliance**  
1. **Systems must be continuously monitored** for configuration deviations.  
   - **SIEM tools and compliance scanners must audit configurations regularly**.  
   - **Deviations from security baselines must be flagged for review**.  
2. **Security hardening baselines must be updated regularly**.  

---

### **4.4 Configuration Change Management**  
1. **All configuration changes must be logged and approved** via IT change management procedures.  
2. **Unauthorized configuration changes must trigger alerts** for investigation.  
3. **Critical security patches and updates must be applied within SLA timelines**.  

---

### **4.5 Secure Configuration Enforcement Methods**  

| **System Type** | **Enforcement Method** |
|----------------|------------------------|
| **Windows Servers & Workstations** | Intune policy enforcement, Group Policy, Ansible |
| **Linux Servers** | CIS Benchmarks, AppArmor, Ansible |
| **Kubernetes Clusters** | Admission Controllers, CIS Kube-Bench |
| **Cloud Services** | Enforced via Azure Policy & Terraform |
| **Firewalls & Network Appliances** | Configuration templates, audit logging |

```

## **4. Best Practices for Implementing This Policy**  

Organizations implementing **CIS Control 9 â€“ Secure Configuration Management** may consider the following best practices:  

- **Automated Configuration Management** â€“ Use **Ansible, Terraform, or cloud-native automation** to enforce configurations.  
- **Baseline Hardening** â€“ Apply **CIS Benchmarks, DISA STIGs, or vendor hardening guides** to all systems.  
- **Configuration Drift Monitoring** â€“ Detect unauthorized changes using **SIEM tools, integrity monitoring, and compliance scans**.  
- **Zero Trust Configurations** â€“ Restrict access to **only what is necessary for system operation**.  
- **Change Control & Logging** â€“ Log all configuration changes and enforce **review & approval workflows**.  

These strategies ensure a **structured approach to secure configuration management** while improving **security posture and compliance readiness**.

## **5. Example Implementation in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**  

In the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab**, CIS Control 9 is implemented with the following measures:  

### **5.1 System Hardening & Configuration Enforcement**  

âœ… **Golden Templates used for OS deployments (Windows, Linux).**  
âœ… **Ansible & Intune automate policy enforcement.**  
âœ… **AppArmor & CIS Benchmarks applied to Linux systems.**  

### **5.2 DNS & Network Security Enforcement**  

âœ… **Technitium DNS with blocklists prevents malicious domain resolution.**  
âœ… **All domains use DNSSEC, DKIM, and DMARC for email security.**  
âœ… **TLS 1.3 is enforced for all encrypted communications.**  

### **5.3 Secure Email & Domain Security Policies**  

âœ… **Azure/Exchange Online manages email with phishing & malware filtering.**  
âœ… **DKIM, DMARC, and DNSSEC enforced for all domains.**

## **6. Summary and Next Steps**  

âœ… **This document presents the official CISv8 Secure Configuration Management Policy Template.**  
âœ… **It includes additional information on possible solutions for implementation.**  
âœ… **A high-level example from the Proxmox Astronomy Lab is provided for reference.**  

ðŸ“Œ **Actionable Next Steps:**  

- **Ensure secure baselines are documented and enforced across all systems.**  
- **Implement automated configuration management to prevent drift.**  
- **Regularly review and update security baselines as threats evolve.**  

ðŸš€ **By following this framework, organizations can ensure structured, secure, and auditable configuration management.**
