# 🛠️ **4. Implementation & Usage**

This section provides systematic guidance for implementing Audit Policy DCs configuration and establishing Domain Controller security logging across domain infrastructure.

## **4.1 Prerequisites**

This subsection identifies requirements for successful Audit Policy DCs implementation within Domain Controller infrastructure.

Audit Policy DCs implementation requires enterprise Domain Controller infrastructure with appropriate administrative access and comprehensive domain security monitoring capabilities:

- **Domain Controller Infrastructure**: Windows Server 2025 Domain Controllers with Group Policy application capability
- **Administrative Access**: Domain Admin or equivalent Group Policy management permissions for DC-specific audit policy configuration

Audit Policy DCs monitoring leverages the centralized monitoring stack on proj-mon01 (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, AlertManager, Grafana Alloy) for systematic Domain Controller security event collection and analysis. The monitoring philosophy of "if it can be collected, we do" applies to all DC-specific security events with specialized correlation for Kerberos operations, Active Directory changes, and domain authentication monitoring.

Monitoring includes Domain Controller security event correlation, Kerberos attack detection, and Active Directory integrity validation through comprehensive domain security monitoring infrastructure and automated alerting for critical domain security events.

# 🔐 **5. Security & Compliance**

This section establishes security framework alignment and compliance requirements for Audit Policy DCs configuration within enterprise Domain Controller security architecture.

## **5.1 Security Framework Alignment**

This subsection maps Audit Policy DCs configuration to enterprise security frameworks and compliance requirements for systematic Domain Controller audit management.

**Security Disclaimer**: The Audit Policy DCs configuration documented in this guide represents a specialized Domain Controller security logging baseline establishment for Windows Server 2025 Active Directory infrastructure. These configurations should be thoroughly tested in non-production environments before deployment. While these templates follow CIS Controls v8 audit log management framework guidelines, organizations should validate policy compatibility with their specific domain operational requirements and monitoring capacity. The security research computing team maintains these configurations as implementation guidance rather than production security recommendations, and encourages consultation with dedicated security professionals for enterprise deployment validation.
