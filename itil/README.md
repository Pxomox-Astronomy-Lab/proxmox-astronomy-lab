# **ITIL Processes - Proxmox Astronomy Lab**

## **1. Overview**

The Proxmox Astronomy Lab implements a unique **role-based simulation approach** to enterprise IT Service Management (ITSM) that allows a **single operator to experience and practice ITIL processes** in a realistic environment. Rather than simplifying ITIL to the point of irrelevance, this approach embraces its complexity by systematically rotating through defined roles to build a comprehensive service management practice.

This simulation provides both **practical ITSM experience** and a **structured framework** for managing the lab's infrastructure and services while aligning with industry best practices.

### **1.1 Core Concept**

The simulation is built on a simple but powerful premise: **a single person can experience the full ITIL framework** by methodically assuming different roles within structured processes. This approach:

✅ **Provides experience with enterprise-grade ITSM practices**  
✅ **Creates realistic documentation from multiple service perspectives**  
✅ **Builds transferable skills applicable to larger organizations**  
✅ **Ensures consistent, high-quality infrastructure management**  
✅ **Prevents the "lone admin" syndrome of unstructured home labs**

## **2. The Simulation Approach**

### **2.1 Simulation Philosophy**

This simulation centers around the concept of a **"service management nexus"** - where ITIL principles flow across various IT domains through a structured rotation of perspectives. Unlike traditional ITIL implementations with separate teams and specialists, this approach emphasizes:

| **Traditional ITIL Implementation** | **Proxmox Astronomy Lab Simulation** |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Multiple specialists in distinct roles | Single operator rotating through functional role groups |
| Formal handoffs between teams | Direct experience of cross-functional workflows |
| Extensive documentation and rituals | Practical documentation focused on learning objectives |
| Clear organizational hierarchy | Streamlined role structure covering key functions |

### **2.2 Benefits Over Simplified Approaches**

Many individual operators attempt to implement ITIL but end up with oversimplified, ineffective processes. This simulation avoids common pitfalls by:

- **Maintaining role integrity** - Each role has distinct perspectives and priorities
- **Ensuring proper process flows** - Following complete processes rather than shortcuts
- **Creating authentic documentation** - Developing comprehensive, multi-perspective documentation
- **Building enterprise-grade skills** - Practicing processes as they exist in mature environments

---

## **3. Simulated Roles**

The lab implements a hybrid model where each primary simulation role encompasses several related ITIL roles based on natural functional groupings:

### **3.1 Primary Roles and ITIL Functions**

| **Simulation Role** | **Encompasses ITIL Roles** | **Primary Responsibilities** |
|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Lab Owner** | IT Steering Group, Service Portfolio Manager, Financial Manager | Strategic direction, portfolio decisions, budgeting, prioritization |
| **Engineer** | Enterprise Architect, Technical Analyst, Infrastructure Engineer | Infrastructure design, service architecture, technical implementation |
| **Operations** | IT Operations Manager, Problem Manager, Service Level Manager | Day-to-day operations, monitoring, stability, incident response |
| **Security Administrator** | Information Security Manager, Access Manager, Compliance Manager | Security controls, compliance verification, risk management |
| **Service Desk** | 1st Level Support, Service Request Fulfillment, Knowledge Manager | User support, service requests, knowledge articles |
| **Change Management** | Change Manager, Change Advisory Board, Release Manager | Change control, release coordination, configuration management |
| **Continuous Improvement** | CSI Manager, Process Owner, Service Owner | Service improvements, process refinement, service ownership |

### **3.2 Role Rotation Methodology**

Roles are rotated according to:

1. **Process-Based Rotation** - Different roles engage based on the ITIL process being executed
2. **Service Lifecycle Focus** - Rotations follow the natural ITIL service lifecycle stages
3. **Issue-Based Assignment** - Specific issues trigger involvement from appropriate roles
4. **Temporal Allocation** - Dedicating specific time periods to specific roles

This ensures comprehensive coverage of ITIL practices while maintaining practicality.

## **4. ITSM Tool Implementation**

The lab uses **GLPI (Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique)** as the core platform to support ITIL processes. GLPI provides a comprehensive ITIL-aligned framework that enables practical implementation of service management concepts.

| **Change Management** | Change Control, Release Management | Change Management, All Roles |
| **Service Desk** | Incident Management, Request Fulfillment | Service Desk, Operations |
| **Problem Management** | Problem Control, Known Error Database | Operations, Engineer |
| **Knowledge Base** | Knowledge Management | Service Desk, All Roles |
| **SLA Management** | Service Level Management | Operations, Service Desk |

### **4.2 GLPI Configuration for Single-Operator Simulation**

GLPI has been configured to support our role-based simulation through:

- **Role-specific user accounts** with appropriate permissions
- **Custom workflows** that enforce ITIL processes
- **Automation rules** that simulate interactions between roles
- **Notification templates** for process communication
- **Dashboard customization** for role-specific views
