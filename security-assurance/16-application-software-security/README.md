# üîê **CIS Control 16: Application Security & Software Integrity**

## üîç **1. Introduction**

CIS Control 16 forms a critical component of our software security strategy, establishing comprehensive controls throughout the application lifecycle. This control ensures that security is integrated into every phase of development, from initial coding through deployment and maintenance.

Ensuring **secure software development and deployment** is critical for **maintaining the integrity, security, and reliability of applications**. **CIS Control 16** mandates a structured approach to **application security, software integrity, and compliance** to reduce risks and prevent vulnerabilities.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** employs **secure coding practices, container security, dependency management, and continuous security monitoring** in compliance with **CISv8, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001**.

The following table outlines our key application security components and their implementation:

| **Key Software Security Features** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Secure Software Development** | Adheres to CIS-compliant secure coding standards. |
| **Public Repository Management** | **GitHub** hosts public releases with issue tracking and pull request acceptance. |
| **Container & Dependency Security** | Managed through **Snipe-IT and Azure Container Registry (ACR)**. |
| **Trusted Libraries & Dependencies** | Only vetted libraries are used (e.g., **NASA Astronomy Libraries, Astropy**). |
| **Secure Deployment Pipelines** | Hardened **Docker configurations, Helm charts, RKE2 Kubernetes deployments**. |
| **Development Isolation** | Dev workloads are deployed in **a dedicated namespace on the K8s cluster**. |
| **Code Scanning & Security Audits** | **GitHub code scanning** enabled for **proxmox-astronomy-lab repo**. |

This integrated approach ensures that security is built into our software throughout its lifecycle, from initial development through deployment and maintenance.

## üéØ **2. Scope**

This control applies to all software development and deployment activities within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab environment, establishing clear requirements for application security while acknowledging practical limitations.

The following table outlines the scope boundaries for our application security program:

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | All software development, containerized workloads, and infrastructure deployments. |
| **Out-of-Scope** | Temporary scripts, research tools, and non-production development environments. |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 16, NIST 800-53 (SA-11), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.14.2). |

This defined scope ensures that security resources are focused on the most critical application components while maintaining compliance with applicable frameworks.

## üíª **3. Secure Software Implementation**

### **3.1 Secure Software Development & Deployment**

Secure software development follows a structured approach that integrates security throughout the development lifecycle. Our implementation ensures that security is considered from initial design through deployment.

The following table details our development and deployment implementation:

| **Security Measure** | **Implementation** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Public Releases** | GitHub-hosted with issue tracking and PR acceptance. |
| **Version Control & Audits** | All changes managed via **Git** for tracking and auditing. |
| **Secure CI/CD Pipelines** | GitHub Actions for automated builds and security scanning. |

This structured approach provides visibility into the development process while ensuring appropriate security controls are maintained.

### **3.2 Container & Dependency Security**

Software components and dependencies represent significant security considerations that must be carefully managed throughout the application lifecycle.

The following table outlines our artifact and dependency security implementation:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Software Inventory Management** | **Snipe-IT** tracks all applications and dependencies. |
| **Container Registry & SBOMs** | **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** manages containers securely. |
| **Dependency Security** | Trusted libraries (e.g., **Astropy, NASA Astronomy Libraries**) are used. |

This comprehensive approach ensures that all software components are properly tracked, vetted, and secured throughout their lifecycle.

### **3.3 Infrastructure & Deployment Protection**

Deployment and infrastructure security are essential components of our defense-in-depth strategy. Our approach ensures that deployed applications maintain appropriate security controls in production environments.

The following table outlines our infrastructure security implementation:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Secure Containers & Infrastructure** | Hardened **Docker, Helm charts, and RKE2 Kubernetes deployments**. |
| **Data Security Standards** | **Database TLS connections, encryption at rest**. |
| **Development Environment Isolation** | **Dedicated K8s dev namespace** for testing before deployment. |

These security measures ensure that applications remain protected throughout the deployment process and during production operations.

### **3.4 Code Security Scanning & Continuous Monitoring**

Continuous security monitoring is essential for identifying vulnerabilities throughout the application lifecycle.

The following table outlines our security scanning and monitoring implementation:

| **Requirement** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **GitHub Code Scanning** | Enabled for **proxmox-astronomy-lab repo** to detect security issues. |
| **CI/CD Security Checks** | GitHub Actions scan for vulnerabilities before merging. |
| **Continuous Security Reviews** | Security policies reviewed annually based on emerging threats. |

This proactive approach ensures that security vulnerabilities are promptly identified and addressed throughout the development lifecycle.

## üìä **4. Compliance Evidence**

Maintaining evidence of control implementation is essential for demonstrating compliance and ensuring continued effectiveness. Our documentation provides comprehensive coverage of each sub-control's implementation.

The following table maps CIS Control 16 sub-controls to our implementation documentation:

| **Control** | **Implementation Details** | **Reference Document** |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **16.1** | Secure software development lifecycle processes. | [CISv8 16.1 Implementation](./16.1.md) |
| **16.2** | Security review and vulnerability management. | [CISv8 16.2 Implementation](./16.2.md) |
| **16.3** | Secure deployment pipelines and infrastructure protections. | [CISv8 16.3 Implementation](./16.3.md) |
| **16.4** | Continuous monitoring and security assessments. | [CISv8 16.4 Compliance](./16.4.md) |

This structured documentation approach ensures that all aspects of the control are properly addressed and verified through regular assessment.
