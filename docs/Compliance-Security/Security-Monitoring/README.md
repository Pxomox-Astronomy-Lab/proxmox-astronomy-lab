# 🔍 **Security Monitoring**

# 🔍 **1. Overview**

This section documents the security monitoring infrastructure, configuration, and operational procedures implemented in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. Our monitoring approach provides comprehensive visibility into security events, compliance status, and potential threats across the lab environment.

The security monitoring solution combines centralized log collection, automated compliance verification, and active threat detection to ensure timely identification of security issues. This documentation covers the technical implementation, operational procedures, and integration with other security components.

# 🔭 **2. Monitoring Architecture**

## **2.1 Core Components**

Our security monitoring architecture consists of several integrated components:

| **Component** | **Purpose** | **Implementation** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Wazuh SIEM** | Security event monitoring and response | Centralized on lab-soc01 | [Wazuh Documentation](Wazuh/README.md) |
| **Log Management** | Centralized logging and analysis | Loki + Grafana integration | [Log Management Documentation](Log-Management/README.md) |
| **Compliance Scanning** | Automated compliance verification | CIS-CAT Lite, custom checks | [Compliance Scanning Documentation](Compliance-Scanning/README.md) |
| **Vulnerability Management** | Vulnerability tracking and remediation | Integrated vulnerability workflow | [Vulnerability Management Documentation](Vulnerability-Management/README.md) |

These components work together to provide comprehensive security visibility across the lab environment.

## **2.2 Architectural Diagram**

The security monitoring infrastructure follows a hub-and-spoke model:

- **Central monitoring servers** (lab-soc01, lab-mon01) collect and analyze security data
- **Distributed agents** on all managed systems collect and forward security information
- **Integration points** with related security systems enhance correlation capabilities
- **Visualization dashboards** provide actionable security insights

For detailed architecture information, see the [Security Architecture](../Security-Policies/Architecture/README.md) documentation.

# 📊 **4. Compliance Monitoring**

## **4.1 Automated Compliance Verification**

Compliance with security baselines is continuously monitored:

| **Standard** | **Verification Method** | **Frequency** | **Documentation** |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **CIS Benchmarks** | CIS-CAT Lite, Wazuh SCA | Daily | [CIS Verification](Compliance-Scanning/cis-verification.md) |
| **Security Policies** | Custom compliance checks | Daily | [Policy Verification](Compliance-Scanning/policy-verification.md) |
| **Vulnerability Status** | Wazuh vulnerability detection | Daily | [Vulnerability Scanning](Vulnerability-Management/scanning.md) |
| **Security Controls** | Security control verification | Weekly | [Control Verification](Compliance-Scanning/control-verification.md) |

This automated approach ensures continuous visibility into compliance status.

## **4.2 Compliance Reporting**

Compliance status is reported through multiple channels:

| **Report Type** | **Audience** | **Frequency** | **Content** |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Compliance Dashboard** | Security Team | Real-time | Current compliance status by system |
| **Trend Analysis** | Lab Owner | Weekly | Compliance trends over time |
| **Detailed Reports** | System Administrators | Weekly | System-specific findings and remediation guidance |
| **Executive Summary** | Lab Owner | Monthly | Overall compliance posture and key metrics |

These reports provide actionable information for maintaining security compliance.

# 📝 **5. Log Management**

## **5.1 Log Collection Architecture**

The lab implements a comprehensive log collection infrastructure:

| **Log Source Type** | **Collection Method** | **Retention Period** | **Analysis Tools** |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **System Logs** | Wazuh agents, syslog forwarding | 180 days | Wazuh decoders, Grafana dashboards |
| **Security Logs** | Wazuh agents, direct collection | One year | Wazuh rules, custom analytics |
| **Application Logs** | Application-specific forwarders | 90 days | Custom parsers, pattern matching |
| **Authentication Logs** | Wazuh agents, direct collection | One year | Authentication analytics, anomaly detection |

This multi-layered approach ensures comprehensive log visibility while maintaining compliance with retention requirements.

## **5.2 Log Analysis Capabilities**

Collected logs undergo detailed analysis:

| **Analysis Type** | **Implementation** | **Use Cases** |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Pattern Matching** | Wazuh rules, log parsers | Known threat identification |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Statistical analysis, behavioral baseline | Zero-day threat detection |
| **Correlation Analysis** | Multi-source event correlation | Complex attack chain identification |
| **Compliance Verification** | Policy-based log checking | Regulatory requirement validation |

These capabilities transform raw log data into actionable security intelligence.

# 🛡️ **6. Vulnerability Management**

## **6.1 Vulnerability Detection**

Vulnerabilities are detected through multiple mechanisms:

| **Detection Method** | **Coverage** | **Frequency** | **Documentation** |
|----------------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Wazuh Vulnerability Detector** | OS packages, applications | Daily | [Wazuh Vulnerability Scanning](Vulnerability-Management/wazuh-vulnerability-scanning.md) |
| **CIS-CAT Lite Scanning** | System configurations | Weekly | [CIS-CAT Scanning](Vulnerability-Management/cis-cat-scanning.md) |
| **Manual Security Testing** | Specialized applications, custom code | Monthly | [Manual Testing](Vulnerability-Management/manual-testing.md) |

This multi-layered approach ensures comprehensive vulnerability identification.

## **6.2 Vulnerability Lifecycle Management**

Identified vulnerabilities follow a structured management process:

| **Lifecycle Stage** | **Activities** | **Tools** | **Documentation** |
|--------------------|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Identification** | Detection and validation | Wazuh, CIS-CAT Lite | [Vulnerability Identification](Vulnerability-Management/identification.md) |

# 🚨 **7. Alert Management**

## **7.1 Alert Prioritization**

Security alerts are prioritized based on severity:

| **Priority Level** | **Criteria** | **Response Time** | **Escalation Path** |
|-------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | Active attacks, critical vulnerabilities | Immediate | Direct notification to Lab Owner and Security Admin |
| **High** | Potential compromise, significant security issues | <1 hour | Security Admin notification |
| **Medium** | Security policy violations, suspicious activity | <8 hours | Addition to daily security report |
| **Low** | Informational alerts, minor violations | <24 hours | Addition to weekly security report |

This prioritization ensures appropriate response to different alert types.

## **7.2 Alert Response Procedures**

Standard procedures guide response to security alerts:

| **Alert Category** | **Initial Response** | **Investigation Steps** | **Documentation** |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Potential Intrusion** | System isolation, preliminary analysis | Forensic investigation, IOC identification | [Intrusion Response](../Security-Policies/Incident-Response/intrusion-response.md) |
| **Malware Detection** | Containment, initial assessment | Malware analysis, impact assessment | [Malware Response](../Security-Policies/Incident-Response/malware-response.md) |
| **Configuration Violation** | Documentation, risk assessment | Root cause analysis, remediation planning | [Compliance Response](../Security-Policies/Incident-Response/compliance-response.md) |
| **Authentication Issues** | Account lockdown, notification | Authentication log analysis, credential review | [Authentication Response](../Security-Policies/Incident-Response/authentication-response.md) |

These procedures ensure consistent, effective response to security events.
