# üîë **Identity**

The Identity section documents the authentication, authorization, and access management systems that secure the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. These services establish the foundation for secure identity verification, role-based access control, and single sign-on across the entire infrastructure.

## üîç **1. Overview**

This overview provides context for the lab's approach to identity management, covering the fundamental components and their integration with other systems.

### **1.1 Purpose**

This section documents the **identity management platform, authentication services, and access control systems** deployed within the Proxmox Astronomy Lab. It serves as a reference for the **architecture, configuration, and administration** of identity infrastructure that secures applications, services, and research data.

### **1.2 Scope**

The following table defines what is included and excluded from this documentation to help readers understand its boundaries.

| **In Scope** | **Out of Scope** |
|--------------|------------------|
| Identity provider deployment and configuration | Application-specific authorization logic |
| Authentication workflow and protocol implementation | Identity governance processes |
| Multi-factor authentication setup | External directory integrations |
| Role-based access control framework | User provisioning workflows |

### **1.3 Target Audience**

Engineers, security administrators, and operators who need to deploy, manage, or integrate with the lab's identity infrastructure.

## üìä **2. Identity Components**

The lab employs a central identity management platform that provides comprehensive authentication and authorization capabilities.

The following table outlines our primary identity components and their documentation:

| **Component** | **Purpose** | **Key Documentation** |
|--------------|------------|----------------------|
| [**Zitadel**](Zitadel/index.md) | Core identity provider and access management | Installation, configuration, user management |

---

## üèóÔ∏è **3. Technical Documentation**

This section covers the technical implementation details of our identity infrastructure, including architectural design and integration approach.

### **3.1 Architecture Overview**

The identity infrastructure is designed to provide secure, centralized authentication and authorization across all lab services:

- **Zitadel** as the primary identity provider and user management system
- **OIDC/OAuth2** for secure authentication and authorization
- **Multi-factor authentication** for enhanced security
- **Role-based access control** for granular permissions
- **Single sign-on** for seamless user experience

### **3.2 Infrastructure Components**

The following table details the key infrastructure components that make up our identity solution:

| **Component** | **Description** | **CMDB ID** |
|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Identity Server | Zitadel identity provider | lab-identity01 |
| Identity Database | PostgreSQL database for identity data | lab-db01-identity |
| MFA Devices | User-owned MFA devices (TOTP, WebAuthn) | N/A |
| Client Applications | Services integrated with Zitadel | Multiple |

### **3.3 Dependencies**

The following table outlines the dependencies and relationships between our identity system and other infrastructure components:

| **Dependency Type** | **Service/Component** | **Impact if Unavailable** |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Requires** | PostgreSQL Database | Identity data storage unavailable |
| **Requires** | Docker Container Runtime | Identity service unavailable |
| **Requires** | Network Infrastructure | Authentication disrupted |
| **Required By** | All Lab Applications | Authentication failures |
| **Required By** | Admin Interfaces | Administrative access blocked |
| **Required By** | Research Platforms | User access to research tools impacted |

## üìà **4. Service Management**

This section describes how identity services are managed, including access control and monitoring approaches.

### **4.1 Access Management**

The following table outlines the access management approach for identity services:

| **User Role** | **Access Level** | **Authorization Process** |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Identity Administrator | Full administration | Approved by Lab Owner |
| Security Administrator | Security policy management | Approved by Lab Owner |
| Application Owner | Application registration rights | Approved by Identity Administrator |
| Operations | Monitoring and basic user management | Approved by Identity Administrator |

### **4.2 Monitoring & Alerting**

The following table details the key metrics monitored for identity systems and their associated alert thresholds:

| **Metric** | **Threshold** | **Alert Severity** |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Service Availability | <99.99% uptime | Critical |
| Authentication Failures | >5 in 5 minutes for same user | Warning |
| Administrative Actions | Any privileged action | Info |
| MFA Enrollment Changes | Any change | Info |
| Suspicious Login Patterns | Anomalous login behavior | Critical |
| Database Connectivity | Any disruption | Critical |

## üîÑ **5. Operational Procedures**

This section covers routine procedures and troubleshooting approaches for identity management.

### **5.1 Routine Procedures**

The following table outlines standard operational procedures for identity management:

| **Procedure** | **Frequency** | **Role Responsible** | **Procedure Document** |
|---------------|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| User Access Review | Quarterly | Security Administrator | [Access Review](Zitadel/Access-Review.md) |
| Security Policy Review | Monthly | Security Administrator | [Security Policy Review](Zitadel/Security-Policy-Review.md) |
| MFA Compliance Audit | Monthly | Security Administrator | [MFA Audit](Zitadel/MFA-Audit.md) |
| Service Backup | Daily | Operations | [Identity Backup](../File-Storage/Restic/Identity-Backup.md) |

### **5.2 Troubleshooting**

The following table provides guidance for addressing common identity-related issues:

| **Common Issue** | **Symptoms** | **Resolution Steps** | **KEDB ID** |
|------------------|------------|---------------------|------------|
| Authentication Failures | Users unable to log in | Verify user status, check service logs | KEDB-ID-001 |
| MFA Registration Issues | Users unable to register MFA | Verify device compatibility, check enrollment process | KEDB-ID-002 |
| Application Integration Failures | Service unable to authenticate users | Check client configuration, verify scopes | KEDB-ID-003 |
