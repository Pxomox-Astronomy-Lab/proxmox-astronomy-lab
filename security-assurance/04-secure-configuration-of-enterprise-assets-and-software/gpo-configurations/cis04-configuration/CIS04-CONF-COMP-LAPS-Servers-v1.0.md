# 🔐 **CIS04-CONF-COMP-LAPS-Servers-v1.0**

This document provides comprehensive configuration details for the Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) security hardening Group Policy Object, implementing CIS Control 4 (Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software) through automated local administrator password management on Member Servers in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab infrastructure.

# 🎯 **1. Introduction**

This section establishes the foundational context for LAPS security configuration within the enterprise Windows hardening framework.

## **1.1 Purpose**

This subsection explains how the LAPS GPO contributes to systematic credential security by automating local administrator password management and eliminating shared administrator passwords through centralized password control.

The LAPS GPO implements critical credential management security by automating local administrator password rotation, encryption, and centralized storage, eliminating the security risks associated with shared local administrator passwords across server infrastructure. This configuration ensures that each server maintains unique, regularly rotated local administrator credentials while providing secure, auditable access through centralized password retrieval mechanisms essential for enterprise security operations and incident response capabilities.

## **1.2 Scope**

This subsection defines the boundaries of LAPS security configuration within the Windows Server 2025 security baseline implementation.

The GPO applies comprehensive local administrator password management to all Member Servers across the infrastructure, targeting Windows LAPS functionality through Administrative Template policy enforcement. The configuration scope encompasses password backup directory configuration, encryption requirements, complexity enforcement, rotation scheduling, and post-authentication security actions, providing systematic protection against credential-based attacks while maintaining operational functionality for legitimate administrative access.

# 🔗 **2. Dependencies & Relationships**

This section maps how the LAPS GPO integrates with other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security components, establishing both upstream and downstream dependencies.

## **2.1 Related Services**

This subsection identifies other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security services that interact with LAPS configuration management.

The LAPS GPO operates within the comprehensive identity and access management framework, coordinating with Active Directory authentication systems, privileged access management tools, and security monitoring platforms to ensure consistent credential security across the server infrastructure.
