# 🔐 **CIS04-CONF-COMP-GroupPolicy-AllDomain-v1.0**

This document provides comprehensive configuration details for the Windows Group Policy processing security hardening Group Policy Object, implementing CIS Control 4 (Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software) through systematic Group Policy processing continuity enforcement and Connected Data Platform disabling to maintain enterprise security boundaries across all domain-joined computers in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab infrastructure.

# 🎯 **1. Introduction**

This section establishes the foundational context for Group Policy processing security configuration within the enterprise Windows hardening framework.

## **1.1 Purpose**

This subsection explains how the Group Policy GPO contributes to systematic security hardening by ensuring reliable Group Policy processing and preventing unauthorized data collection through Connected Data Platform.

The Group Policy GPO implements critical security controls by systematically ensuring Group Policy registry processing continuity during background refresh operations, preventing Group Policy list change notifications from being skipped, and disabling the Connected Data Platform service that could enable unauthorized telemetry collection. This configuration ensures that Group Policy enforcement operations maintain enterprise security boundaries while supporting legitimate policy management essential for business operations, providing comprehensive protection against policy bypass and unauthorized data transmission.

## **1.2 Scope**

This subsection defines the boundaries of Group Policy processing security configuration within the Windows Server 2025 security baseline implementation.

The GPO applies comprehensive Group Policy processing controls to all domain-joined computers across the infrastructure, targeting Windows Group Policy functionality through registry policy enforcement. The configuration scope encompasses registry policy processing continuity, Group Policy refresh reliability, and Connected Data Platform controls, providing systematic protection against policy enforcement bypass while maintaining operational functionality for approved policy management and legitimate administrative workflows.

# 🔗 **2. Dependencies & Relationships**

This section maps how the Group Policy GPO integrates with other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security components, establishing both upstream and downstream dependencies.

## **2.1 Related Services**

This subsection identifies other Proxmox Astronomy Lab security services that interact with Group Policy processing security configuration management.

The Group Policy GPO operates within the comprehensive policy enforcement framework, coordinating with Active Directory services, domain controller operations, and security policy management to ensure consistent Group Policy processing across the infrastructure while maintaining approved administrative functionality.
