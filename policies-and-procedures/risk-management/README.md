# ⚠️ **Risk Management Policies & Procedures**

This directory contains risk management policies and procedures for the Proxmox Astronomy Lab, documenting risk assessment frameworks, security risk management, operational risk controls, and research data protection policies. These procedures establish systematic risk identification, assessment, and mitigation strategies supporting enterprise security requirements and research computing operational excellence.

## **Overview**

The risk management framework provides systematic approaches to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks across our enterprise astronomical computing platform while balancing security requirements with research productivity needs. Our implementation addresses the unique risk profile of astronomical research computing including low-risk research data characteristics, operational continuity requirements, and security considerations appropriate for scientific computing environments.

Risk management policies recognize that astronomical research data presents minimal security risks compared to traditional enterprise data while maintaining appropriate operational and security controls to ensure platform reliability, research continuity, and compliance with institutional security requirements.

## **Risk Assessment Framework**

### **Risk Classification Model**

**Risk Categories:**

- **Security Risks**: Information security, access control, and data protection risks
- **Operational Risks**: System availability, performance, and operational continuity risks
- **Compliance Risks**: Regulatory compliance and institutional policy adherence risks
- **Research Risks**: Research data integrity, availability, and collaboration risks
- **Technology Risks**: Infrastructure reliability, technology obsolescence, and vendor risks

**Risk Likelihood Assessment:**

- **High**: Likely to occur within 1 year based on historical data and threat assessment
- **Medium**: Possible occurrence within 2-3 years based on environmental factors
- **Low**: Unlikely occurrence beyond 3 years or requiring multiple failure conditions
- **Negligible**: Extremely unlikely based on current controls and threat landscape

**Risk Impact Assessment:**

- **Critical**: Significant impact on research operations, data loss, or security breach
- **High**: Moderate impact on operations with potential for research disruption
- **Medium**: Limited operational impact with minimal research productivity effects
- **Low**: Minor impact with no significant operational or research consequences

### **Research Data Risk Profile**

**Astronomical Research Data Characteristics:**

- **Public Data**: DESI DR1 and astronomical survey data are publicly available datasets
- **Research Publications**: Analysis results intended for public scientific publication
- **Collaborative Research**: Data sharing essential for scientific collaboration and validation
- **No Sensitive Information**: No personal, financial, or confidential business information
- **Scientific Value**: Primary value in research integrity and analysis reproducibility

**Risk Assessment Conclusions:**

- **Low Security Risk**: Astronomical research data presents minimal confidentiality risks
- **Medium Availability Risk**: Research productivity depends on data and system availability
- **High Integrity Risk**: Research validity requires data integrity and analysis reproducibility
- **Low Compliance Risk**: Limited regulatory requirements for public scientific data
