# **üîê CIS Control 6: Access Control Management in the Proxmox Astronomy Lab**

## **1. Introduction**

Controlling **who has access to what, and when** is fundamental to securing enterprise environments. **CIS Control 6** mandates **identity governance, least privilege access, and multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to prevent **unauthorized access and privilege escalation**.

The **Proxmox Astronomy Lab** enforces strict **access control policies** through structured automation and governance.

| **Security Measure** | **Implementation** |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Identity Governance** | Entra Access Packages & Reviews control access. |
| **Zero-Trust Network Access** | Entra Private Access (EPA) secures remote access. |
| **MFA & Phish-Resistant Authentication** | Enforced for all privileged accounts. |
| **Centralized Identity Management** | Azure Arc integrates on-prem authentication. |
| **Automated Account Revocation** | Least privilege enforcement with structured role-based access control (RBAC). |

## **2. Scope**

| **Category**  | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **In-Scope** | All user, system, and service accounts (AD, Entra, and on-prem via Azure Arc). |
| **Out-of-Scope** | Temporary or non-production accounts. |
| **Compliance Mapping** | CIS Control 6, NIST 800-53 (AC-3, AC-6, IA-5), ISO/IEC 27001 (A.9.2.1, A.9.4.1). |

## **3. Sub-Control Implementation**

### **Access Control & Identity Governance**

Structured access management ensures least privilege and identity verification.

| **Control** | **Implementation** |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Access Granting Process** | Entra Access Packages & Reviews define and review access assignments. |
| **Access Revocation Process** | Automated offboarding via Ansible revokes access upon deactivation. |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | Enforced for all external apps and privileged access. |
| **Zero-Trust Remote Access** | Entra Private Access replaces VPNs with identity-based network security. |

### **Privileged Access & Role-Based Enforcement**

All administrative access follows just-in-time (JIT) principles with strong authentication.

| **Security Measure** | **Enforcement** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Privileged Access Security** | Admins require JIT elevation & phish-resistant MFA. |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Defined roles govern structured access assignments. |
| **Authentication Inventory** | Snipe-IT tracks all authentication & authorization systems. |
| **Centralized Identity Management** | Azure Arc extends Entra ID to on-prem resources. |

## **4. Compliance Evidence**

| **Sub-Control** | **Implementation Details** | **Reference Document** |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **6.1** | Entra Identity Governance controls access granting. | [CISv8 6.1 Implementation](./6.1.md) |
| **6.2** | Automated revocation & offboarding process. | [CISv8 6.2 Implementation](./6.2.md) |
| **6.3** | MFA enforcement for external apps. | [CISv8 6.3 Implementation](./6.3.md) |
| **6.5** | Phish-resistant MFA for privileged access. | [CISv8 6.5 Implementation](./6.5.md) |
| **6.8** | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) definitions & reviews. | [CISv8 6.8 Compliance](./6.8.md) |

üìå **Each sub-control has a dedicated document outlining its enforcement and validation.**
