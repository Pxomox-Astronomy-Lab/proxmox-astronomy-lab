# **📂 Assets Directory Overview**  

## **1. Introduction**  

The **`assets/`** directory contains **supporting files** for documentation, including:  

- **Diagrams** (architecture, security models, workflow visualizations).  
- **Compliance Artifacts** (evidence for CIS, NIST, and ISO reporting).  
- **Screenshots** (GUI-based configurations for documentation).  

This folder ensures **all visual and reference materials are centralized** and easily accessible.

## **2. Folder Structure**  

| **Folder** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| `diagrams/` | Architecture, network topology, and compliance diagrams. |
| `screenshots/` | Images supporting technical documentation. |
| `compliance/` | Supporting evidence for audits, control mappings, and compliance reviews. |

---

## **3. Usage Guidelines**  

✅ **Ensure images are optimized** before committing to the repository.  
✅ **Use meaningful file names** (e.g., `network_topology_2025.png` instead of `image1.png`).  
✅ **Diagrams should be stored in vector format** (`.svg` preferred).  
✅ **Compliance evidence must be sanitized** before adding to public documentation.
