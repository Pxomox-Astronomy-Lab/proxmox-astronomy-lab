# üîó **Unified Documentation Strategy**

This document provides comprehensive unified documentation strategy for the Proxmox Astronomy Lab, establishing systematic git submodule integration, ReadTheDocs publication framework, and coordinated repository management enabling seamless organizational knowledge discovery from enterprise documentation through lab infrastructure to individual research projects while maintaining repository autonomy, specialized content development, and collaborative scientific computing operations across distributed teams and complex technical domains.

## **Overview**

The unified documentation strategy establishes systematic integration of diverse repositories into cohesive organizational knowledge base through the planned `proxmox-astronomy-lab-docs` master repository containing all subordinate repositories as git submodules, enabling unified ReadTheDocs publication while preserving individual repository autonomy and specialized content development. This approach supports seamless knowledge discovery across organizational, infrastructure, and project domains while maintaining development velocity and domain expertise.

Strategy implementation encompasses systematic repository coordination through git submodule integration, automated or manual synchronization procedures ensuring current content reflection, ReadTheDocs publication providing unified access point for all organizational knowledge, and comprehensive navigation architecture enabling intuitive knowledge discovery from strategic organizational guidance through technical infrastructure documentation to specialized research project content supporting collaborative astronomical research operations and enterprise infrastructure development.
