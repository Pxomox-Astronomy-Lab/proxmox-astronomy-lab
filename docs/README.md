# **Proxmox Astronomy Lab Documentation**

---

# âš  Disclaimer

This project is a transparent, living process where we document our successes and our mistakes. We follow real-world ITIL project management principles, but this is also a learning experience. We show our work warts and all for transparency. Mistakes and course corrections are part of the process, and that's intentional.

ðŸ”¹ Security policies and best practices should not be blindly lifted from this repo. Every lab has unique needs, and configurations here are tailored to our environment. Always review and adapt security measures accordingly.

## **1. Overview**

Welcome to the **Proxmox Astronomy Lab documentation hub** â€“ a comprehensive knowledge base documenting our infrastructure, processes, and research activities. This documentation serves as both a **practical operational resource** and a **public reference implementation** for others interested in building similar research environments.

### **Key Features:**

âœ… **Complete infrastructure documentation** from hardware to application services
âœ… **CISv8-compliant security and compliance documentation**
âœ… **ITIL-aligned process documentation**
âœ… **Structured for both human readability and AI-assisted search**
âœ… **Versioned, auditable, and continuously updated**

---

## **2. Documentation Structure**

Our documentation is organized into logical sections that reflect the core components of the Proxmox Astronomy Lab:

| **Section** | **Purpose** | **Content Types** |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [**applications-services**](#applications-services) | Documents all running applications and services | Service docs, configurations, dependencies |
| [**compliance-security**](#compliance-security) | Security frameworks and implementation | CISv8 controls, policies, hardening guides |
| [**documentation-processes**](#documentation-processes) | Meta-documentation and templates | KB templates, style guides, processes |
| [**entra-hybrid-cloud**](#entra-hybrid-cloud) | Microsoft Entra ID integration | Identity management, conditional access |
| [**infrastructure**](#infrastructure) | Core infrastructure components | Hardware, virtualization, networking |
| [**itil-processes**](#itil-processes) | ITIL service management docs | Change management, incident management |
| [**observatory-projects**](#observatory-projects) | Scientific research documentation | Research methodologies, data analyses |
| [**simulation-approach**](#simulation-approach) | Lab simulation methodology | Role-based simulation approach |
| [**troubleshooting-procedures**](#troubleshooting-procedures) | Problem resolution guides | Common issues, diagnostic procedures |

Each section has its own README providing further details about the section's content and structure.

## **3. Technical Approach**

### **3.1 Markdown with Frontmatter**

We've chosen **Markdown with YAML frontmatter** as our documentation format for several key reasons:

| **Feature** | **Benefit** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Plain Text Format** | Version-control friendly, easy to diff and merge |
| **YAML Frontmatter** | Rich metadata for classification and retrieval |
| **Simple Syntax** | Low barrier to contribution and maintenance |
| **Widespread Support** | Compatible with most documentation tools |
| **Rendering Flexibility** | Can be displayed as HTML, PDF, or other formats |

Example of our frontmatter structure:

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
description: "Concise description of the document's purpose and content"
author: "Author Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
category: "Primary Category"
kb_type: "Reference/Tutorial/Procedure/Troubleshooting"
version: "1.0"
status: "Draft/Published"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
---
```

### **3.2 RAG-Optimized Documentation**

Our documentation is designed to work seamlessly with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems:

| **RAG Feature** | **Implementation** |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Consistent Metadata** | Structured frontmatter with controlled vocabulary |
| **Content Chunking** | Logical section breaks with clear headers |
| **Semantic Linking** | Related document references and explicit relationships |
| **Vector Embeddings** | Documents optimized for embedding-based retrieval |
| **Contextual Queries** | Support for natural language querying via OpenWebUI |

When fully implemented, you'll be able to ask questions like "What's the CISv8 compliance status of VM X?" and receive context-aware responses backed by our documentation.

### **3.3 Templates and Standardization**

To ensure consistency, we use standardized templates for different document types:

- [**General KB Template**](documentation-processes/template-kb-general.md) - For general knowledge base articles
- [**Service Documentation Template**](documentation-processes/template-kb-service.md) - For documenting services and applications

These templates are designed for both human authors and AI assistance, ensuring all required information is consistently captured.

## **5. Contributing to Documentation**

All documentation follows our established templates and style guides:

1. **Use the appropriate template** for the type of document you're creating
2. **Complete all frontmatter fields** with accurate metadata
3. **Follow the style guide** for formatting and structure
4. **Link related documents** explicitly within your content
5. **Submit documentation changes** through normal Git workflow

Documentation changes are subject to the same review process as infrastructure changes.
